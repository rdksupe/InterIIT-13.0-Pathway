### Chain of Thought (COT)

To address the user's request, we need to gather information about the current state of the ed-tech sector in both India and the US, analyze the potential acquisition of Byju's by Chegg, and evaluate the impacts of such a merger on the market from various perspectives. Given the complexity of the task, it can be broken down into sub-tasks that focus on distinct aspects, allowing for parallel execution wherever possible.

1. **State of the Ed-Tech Sector in India**: This task assesses the current trends, challenges, and growth opportunities specific to the ed-tech landscape in India. This requires market analysis and could utilize a web search for the latest reports or summaries.

2. **State of the Ed-Tech Sector in the US**: Similar to the first task but focused on the US market. We will again rely on web search for up-to-date information about the sector.

3. **Feasibility of Chegg Acquiring Byju's**: This task investigates whether this acquisition is possible based on factors like financials, strategic fit, and market conditions. We could use financial data tools to get insights into both companies.

4. **Impact of the Acquisition on the Ed-Tech Market in India**: Analyzing how the merger would affect competition, consumer choice, and innovation in the Indian ed-tech scenario. This task relies on the feasibility assessment.

5. **Impact of the Acquisition on the Ed-Tech Market in the US**: Similar to the previous sub-task but focused on the US context. This too relies on the feasibility assessment.

6. **Public Policy and Regulatory Implications**: Investigates any legal issues or regulatory concerns arising from such a merger in India and the US. Aspects covered include local laws, antitrust regulations, and possible challenges.

7. **Financial Analysis of Byju's and Chegg**: This involves a thorough financial examination that could include income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow analyses for both firms. 

By analyzing the interdependencies, we can determine that:
- Tasks related to the state of the ed-tech sector in both countries are independent.
- The feasibility investigation will inform the impact assessments.
- Financial analyses will support understanding the viability of the acquisition and its implications.

### Local and Global Constraints
Each task will have its own local constraints that are specific to its scope:
- **Local Constraints** are related to data availability, timeliness, and access to specific tools or databases.
- **Global Constraints** will cover overall alignment with the userâ€™s request and the accuracy of gathered data.

With this understanding, I will now complete the JSON template to reflect the main task and its detailed subtasks.
