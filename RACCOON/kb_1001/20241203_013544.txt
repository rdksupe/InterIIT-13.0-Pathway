45](https://sensiba.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thomson-reuters-logo-96x96.png) Feb 23, 2023 | [Thomson Reuters](https://sensiba.com/resources/insights/author/thomson-reuters/)\n\n![Image 46: Two

profits compared to revenue and assets, your financial statements may provide insight into what’s happening and how to improve your performance.\n\nWatch for Red Flags\n-------------------\n\nAs you sell more and invest in additional assets, profits should, in theory, increase proportionately. However, that’s not always the case. Ratios to watch for a decline include:\n\n*   Gross profit \\[(revenue – cost of sales) / revenue\\],\n*   Net profit margin (net income / revenue), and\n*   Return on assets (earnings before tax / total assets).\n\nFor all three profitability ratios, look at two key elements: changes between accounting periods and differences from industry averages.\n\nIdentify Possible Causes\n------------------------\n\nIf these ratios are declining, it’s important to find the cause. If the whole industry suffers, the decline is likely part of an external trend. If the industry is healthy, yet a company’s margins are falling, perhaps management has lost control of costs — or maybe vendor or receivables fraud is to blame. To find the root cause, it’s often helpful to study the main components of the income statement.\n\n### Revenue.\n\nIf the top line (gross sales or revenue) has declined, your overall profit margin will fall because there is less revenue to spread fixed costs over. To determine if this trend is company-specific or industrywide, look at revenue trends of public companies in the same industry. Also, monitor trade publications, trade associations, and relevant online sources for information.\n\n### Cost of goods sold.\n\nThis category of expenses is a function of raw materials, labor, and overhead elements. Direct materials and labor should be controllable and historically represent a consistent percentage of revenue.\n\n[Overhead](https://sensiba.com/resources/insights/accounting-for-overhead-costs/) is mostly fixed and shouldn’t significantly increase unless the company has changed (for example, purchased new equipment, changed its depreciation policy, or relocated its production facility). Examine those elements to determine whether overhead is increasing or decreasing and how the ebb and flow applies to the gross margin, which is simply revenue minus cost of goods sold.\n\n### Selling and administrative costs.\n\nCheck whether selling and administrative cost items increased significantly. This section of the income statement can also reveal if you’re trying to determine whether a profit margin decline arose from deteriorating industry conditions or weak management.\n\nFind Clues of the “Why” Behind Declining Profits\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNeed help solving the mystery of your disappearing profits?
