We recorded net \n\ninflows of R$60.8billion reaching R$1.4 trillion in wealth and asset under management , being able to expand \n\nour funding base and increase the retail portion of it. In June, we successfully issued a 10year subordinated \n\nCRA of R$3.5 billion, pr oving our expertise in product offering and the quality of our network and its \n\ndistribution capacity. \n\nOur growing fee income allied with robust risk management allocation and operation al efficiency ensured \n\nthe remarkable results, reflecting the effectivene ss and diversification of our strategy. \n\nBesides 2Q 2023 all -time high revenues and net income of R$5. 4 billion and R$2.6 billion, respectively, we \n\nposted our best half year performance delivering 22.7% ROAE in the quarter and 21.7% in the semester .\n\nOur capital ratios remained robust since we maintain a very liquid balance sheet, with BIS ratio of 15. 4%. \n\nIt’s worth mentioning that since July 1 st our Basel Ratio increased 79bps due to the new RWA reg ulation. \n\nAs previously mentioned, 2Q 202 3 results were strong in all business units . T otal revenues grew 13.3% q -\n\no-q and 20.6% y -o-y, with record revenues in Corporate & SME Lending, Sales & Trading and Wealth \n\nManagement & Consumer Banking and strong net inflows in both Asset and Wealth Management. \n\nCorporate & SME Lending posted R$1,277.3 million revenues, 7.2% above the previous quarte r, which \n\nwas our record . Revenue increase was in line with 7.3% portfolio growth , focused on premium \n\ncounterparties at attractive spreads. \n\nSales & Trading had outstanding performance , increasing 27.1% in the quarter and totaling R$1,887.2 \n\nmillion with growing contribution from fee and flow -base revenues coupled with efficient risk allocation .\n\nWealth Management & Consumer Banking recorded its 18 th consecutive quarter of record revenues, \n\nreaching R$727.1 million, up 4.8% in the quarter, with strong R$35.4 billion net new money , reaching R$ 630 \n\nbillion in wealth under management (WuM). \n\nAsset Management also posted strong net inflows of R$25.4 billion, despite significant AM industry outf lows \n\nof R$131.3 billion during the quarter , proving the robustness of our business, outperforming in challenging \n\nscenarios. Year -to -date AM industry recorded outflows of R$205 billion, while we had positive net inflows \n\nof R$38 billion ( source: Anbima ). R evenues were R$430.7 million, a marginal decrease compared to \n\nprevious quarter due to low performance fees .\n\nInvestment Banking had a 17.5% increase from a weak 1Q 2023 , totaling R$30 5. 6 million of revenues, with \n\nhigher contribution from both ECM and DCM, as market activity started to gain momentum towards the \n\nquarter ’s end. \n\nFinally, Principal Investments and Participations recorded revenues of R$ 71.9 million and losses of R$ 54.2 \n\nmillion , respectively. Participations performance was again impacted by the accounting effects of Banco \n\nPan ’s credit portfolio acquired during the quarter . Without this impact, BTGP Q2 ROAE would have been \n\n25.2 %.4\n\n## Earnings Release \n\n## Second Quarter 202 3\n\nOperating expenses were R$ 2,386.0 million this quarter, 12.4% higher than 1Q 2023 . Higher bonus \n\nexpenses – which are determined by revenue generation – accounted for most of the total operating \n\nexpense growth . Our adjusted cost -to -income ratio ended the quarter at 39 .3%, stable when compared to \n\nprevious quarter. \n\nAccounting net income reached the second consecutive quarterly record of R$ 2,441.2 million, 14.4 % above \n\n1Q 202 3 and 18.1% higher than the same period last year . Shareholders’ equity ended the period at R$ 46.7 \n\nbillion, a 5.7 % q-o-q increase and a 12.9 % y -o-y increase. Our liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) ended the \n\nperiod at 157 %, while the Basel ratio wa s 15. 4%. As previously mentioned, we gain additional 79bps of \n\nBasel Ratio since July 1st due to the new RWA regulation. \n\nESG & Impacting Investing agenda continued to expand during the quarter. We structured and distributed \n\nUS$1.1 billion in green and sustainable bonds and to continue to contribute to a transition economy and \n\njoin efforts to promote carbon markets , w e have recently acquired a minority stake in Systemica, a Brazilian \n\ncompany that structure s, develop s and commercialize s carbon projects and other environmental assets. \n\nWe have also received several awards during 2Q 2023 by Global Finance : (i) Top Financial Innovations: \n\nSustainability/ESG - for being the lead coordinator bank of the first blue bond transaction in Brazil, issued \n\nin Nov/22 , (ii) Outstanding Leadership in Sustainable Finance, in Sustainable Bonds and in Sust ainability \n\nTransparency in LatAm , (iii) Outstanding Sustainable Financing in Emerging Markets , and (iv) Sustainable \n\nFinance Leadership in Brazil . In addition to that , we were recognize d as the Best ESG research team in \n\nLatAm and Brazil by Institutional Investors and, Most Sustainable Bank of Brazil by World Finance. \n\nWe are also glad to announce that for the third consecutive time, we have been ranked first in all the most \n\nrelevant categ ories of Institutional Investors 2023 sales ranking.

Revenues \n\nconsisted of positive equity pick up from investments and were partially offset by higher internal funding \n\ncosts. Global Markets strategy (seed investments) performed better this quarter than in the preceding one. \n\n2Q 202 3 vs. 2Q 20 22 \n\nPrincipal Investments revenues increased 54.8 % compared to 2Q 2022, when we posted gains of \n\nR$ 46.4 million. The in crease was mainly driven by higher contribution from Global Markets, partially offset \n\nby higher internal cost of funding .\n\nParticipations \n\n2Q 202 3 vs. 1Q 202 3\n\nParticipations reported losses of R$ 54.2 million, compared to losses of R$ 70.0 million in the 1Q 202 3.\n\nResults in 2Q 202 3 consisted of (i) R$1 26mn of equity pick up in Banco Pan, (ii) R$ 47 million gains from \n\nToo Seguros and Pan Corretora , (iii) R$58mn accrual of Banco Pan’s credit portfolio acquired in the \n\nprevious quarters and (iv) -R$285mn of accounting effects of Banco Pa n’s credit portfolio acquired during \n\nthe quarter. \n\nAs explained in previous quarters, Banco Pan’s business model includes recurring sales of part of its credit \n\nportfolio. Recently, BTG Pactual decided to acquire part of this portfolio to diversify its cred it exposure at \n\nattractive spreads. If Banco Pan sells these credits to the market, it recognizes a capital gain. However, \n\nwhen these credits are sold do BTG Pactual, this capital gain must be recognized during the portfolio’s \n\nduration since BTG Pactual consolidates Banco Pan. \n\n2Q 202 3 vs. 2Q 20 22\n\nParticipations results were losses of R$ 54.2 million in 2Q 202 3, compared to gains of R$ 98.9 million the \n\nsame period one year ago. The decrease in revenues y-o-y was attributed to the Banco Pan’s portfolio \n\nacquisition explained above. 17 \n\n## Earnings Release \n\n## Second Quarter 202 3\n\nInterest & Others \n\n2Q 202 3 vs. 1Q 202 3\n\nRevenues from Interest & Others were R$ 797.2 million in 2Q 202 3, compared to R$ 745.3 million in 1Q\n\n202 3. The increase was mainly due the expansion of our tangible equity . Interest & Others ’ revenues \n\ncorrespond mainly to interest rates of the Central Bank of Brazil applied over our tangible equity (i.e. internal \n\ncost of funding). \n\n2Q 20 23 vs. 2Q 20 22\n\nRevenues from Interest & Others increased 19.1 % y-o-y, mainly due to higher interest rates as well as the \n\n12. 9% growth in shareholder’s equity from R$ 41.4 billion to R$ 46.7 billion. 18 \n\n## Earnings Release \n\n## Second Quarter 202 3\n\nOperating Expenses \n\nBonus \n\nTotal bonus expenses were R$ 681.3 million in 2Q 202 3, a 29.9 % quarterly growth and a 27.4 % year -over -\n\nyear growth . The increase is mostly attributed to a higher revenue (especially from our client franchises) .\n\nBonuses are determined in accordance with our profit -sharing program and are calculated as a percentage \n\nof our operating revenues (which exclude Interest & Other revenues), reduced by our operating expenses. \n\nSalaries and benefits \n\nStaff costs slightly increased 1.1 % in the quarter and grew 21.5 % compared to 2Q 202 2. The year -over -\n\nyear growth is due to personnel increase, as we added almost 700 people throughout this period, \n\norganically and , inorganically from the acquisitions we have made. Expe nses related to salaries and \n\nbenefits were R$ 535.7 million in 2Q 202 3 and R$ 529.7 million in 1Q 20 23, compared to R$ 440.9 million in \n\n2Q 202 2.\n\nAdministrative and other \n\nTotal administrative and other expenses increased 4.1% during quarter , from R$ 59 9.8 million in 1Q 202 3\n\nto R$ 624.5 million in 2Q 202 3. Year -over -year A&O expenses grew by 15.6 %. \n\nGoodwill amortization \n\nIn 2Q 202 3, we recorded goodwill amortization expenses totaling R$ 245.5 million, 5. 5% above the previous \n\nquarter.

Except where otherwise noted, the information concerning our \n\nresults of operations pres ented in this document is based on our Adjusted Income Statement, which \n\nrepresents a revenue breakdown by business unit net of funding costs and financial expenses allocated to \n\nsuch unit, and a reclassification of certain other expenses and costs. \n\nOur Adj usted Income Statement is derived from the same accounting information used for preparing our \n\nIncome Statement in accordance with Brazilian GAAP and IFRS. The classification of the line items in our \n\nAdjusted Income Statement is unaudited and materially dif fers from the classification and presentation of \n\nthe corresponding line items in our Income Statement. As explained in the notes to the Financial Statements \n\nof BTG Pactual, our financial statements are presented with the exclusive purpose of providing, in a single \n\nset of financial statements and in one GAAP, information related to the operations of BTG Pactual and \n\nrepresents the consolidation of transactions of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. and its subsidiaries. \n\nKey Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) and Ratios \n\nThe key performance indicators (“KPIs”) and ratios are monitored by BTG Pactual’s management and \n\npursued to be achieved across financial periods. Consequently, key indicators calculated based on annual \n\nresults across financial periods may be more me aningful than quarterly results and results of any specific \n\ndate. KPIs are calculated annually and adjusted, when necessary, as part of the strategic planning process \n\nand to reflect regulatory environment or materially adverse market conditions. \n\nThis sect ion contains the basis for presentation and the calculation of selected KPIs and ratios presented \n\nin this report.             \n\n> KPIs and Ratios Description\n> AuM and AuA Assets under management and assets under administration consist of proprietary assets, third party assets, wealth\n> management funds and/or joint investments managed or administrated among a variety of assets classes,\n> including fixed income, equities, money market accounts, multi -market funds and private equity funds.\n> Cost to income ratio It is computed by dividing the adjusted total operating expenses by adjusted total revenues.\n> Compensation ratio It is computed by dividing the sum of adjusted bonus and salaries and benefits expenses by adjusted total\n> revenues.\n> Effective income tax rate It is computed by dividing the adjusted income tax and social contribution or (expense) by the adjusted income\n> before taxes.\n> Net income per unit Net income per unit presents the results of each pro -forma unit formed by 3 different classes of shares of Banco\n> and it considers the outstanding units as of the date of this report.

We\n> determine the average shareholders’ equity based on the initial and final net equity for the quarter.\n\n26 \n\n## Earnings Release \n\n## Second Quarter 202 3\n\nKPIs and Ratios Description \n\nVaR The VaR numbers reported are calculated on a one -day time horizon, a 95.0% confidence level and a one -year \n\nlook -back window. A 95.0% confidence level means that there is a 1 in 20 chance that daily trading net revenues \n\nwill fall below the VaR estimated. Thus, shortfalls f rom expected trading net revenues on a single trading day \n\ngreater than the reported VaR would be anticipated to occur, on average, about once a month. Shortfalls on a \n\nsingle day can exceed reported VaR by significant amounts and they can also occur more fr equently or accumulate \n\nover a longer time horizon, such as a number of consecutive trading days. Given its reliance on historical data, \n\nthe accuracy of VaR is limited in its ability to predict unprecedented market changes, as historical distributions in \n\nma rket risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Different VaR methodologies and \n\ndistributional assumptions can produce materially different VaR. Moreover, VaR calculated for a one -day time \n\nhorizon does not fully capture the ma rket risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within \n\none day. “Stress Test” modeling is used as a complement of VaR in the daily risk management activities. \n\nWuM Wealth under management consists of private wealth clients' assets th at we manage across a variety of asset \n\nclasses, including fixed income, money market, multi -asset funds and merchant banking funds.
