We continue to accelerate our investments in the UK’s leading next generation networks; we're combining our Enterprise and Global operations to create BT Business, a single, strengthened B2B unit; and we’re going further on cutting costs to deliver £3 billion in annualised savings by the end of FY25. “On full fibre, we’re building - and now connecting - like fury: 9.6 million premises reached to date, with 29% already connected, and our 5G mobile network now reaches 60% of the UK population. “In December we awarded a cost-of-living pay rise to 85% of our UK colleagues, reaching an agreement with our union partners that we will all lean into our ongoing transformation plans. Despite extraordinary energy costs and other inflationary headwinds, we are reaffirming our outlook for the year.” \n\nKey strategic developments: \n\n• Announced the merger of Enterprise and Global to create BT Business, to enhance value for all B2B customers, strengthen our competitive position and deliver material synergies as part of our £3bn cost-saving target • Announced CPI-linked price increases to offset cost inflation and pay for increased data usage and investment in our next generation networks • Additional action taken on operating costs to mitigate unforeseen energy, pay and equipment costs • Record FTTP build of 810k premises passed in the quarter at an average build rate of 62k per week; 38% of our 25m FTTP build completed • Customer demand for FTTP extremely strong with orders up 51% year on year; take up 3 rate grew to 29% with net adds of 324k in the quarter; broadband rental ARPU up 7.6% year on year • Openreach announced improved discounts for FTTP connection and rental charges, from April 2023, to support accelerated take up 3 of FTTP; announced the launch of 1.2Gbps and 1.8Gbps products • Record quarterly growth in FTTP base in Consumer, up 155k to 1.6m; 5G ready base now 8.5m; churn remains stable in a competitive market; RootMetrics named EE the UK's best mobile network for a 19th time running • Operational metrics recovering as industrial action ended with cost of living pay rise \n\nReaffirmed all outlook metrics despite inflationary headwinds: \n\n• Revenue £15.6bn, down 1% as price increases and improved trading in Openreach and Consumer were offset by lower strategic equipment sales in Global, migration of a MVNO customer, removal of BT Sport revenue, and legacy product declines; on a Sports Joint Venture ('JV') pro forma 1 basis adjusted revenue was up £65m • Adjusted 1 EBITDA £5.9bn, up 3% due to tight cost control and the removal of BT Sport costs, offset by revenue declines and inflationary cost pressures; on a Sports JV pro forma 1 basis adjusted EBITDA was up 2% • Reported profit before tax £1.3bn, down 15% due to increased depreciation offsetting EBITDA growth • Reported capital expenditure (capex) £3.9bn, up 3% due to increased Openreach investment in fixed network infrastructure offsetting prior-year investment in spectrum; capex excluding spectrum payments up 19%; cash capex was £4.1bn, up 19%; significantly lower capex in Q4 given unwind of Openreach work in progress • Normalised free cash flow 1 £0.1bn, down £0.8bn due to increased cash capex and adverse working capital phasing primarily driven by collections timings, partially offset by a tax refund and EBITDA growth • Net debt was £19.2bn, £1.2bn higher than at 31 March 2022 with normalised free cash flow more than offset by pension scheme contributions and payment of the final dividend • Financial outlook reaffirmed; normalised free cash flow heavily weighted to Q4, reflecting more front-ended capex and back-ended EBITDA and receivable collections than usual \n\nNine months to 31 December 2022 2021 Change \n\nReported measures £m £m %\n\nRevenue 15,593 15,676 (1) Profit before tax 1,307 1,537 (15) Profit after tax 1,320 886 49 Capital expenditure 3,880 3,752 3\n\nAdjusted measures \n\nAdjusted 1 Revenue 15,580 15,677 (1) Adjusted 1 EBITDA 5,880 5,708 3Pro forma 1 Revenue 15,342 15,277 —Pro forma 1 EBITDA 5,951 5,863 2Capital expenditure excluding spectrum 3,880 3,273 19 Normalised free cash flow 1 106 878 (88) % Net debt 1,2 19,226 17,741 £1,485m    \n\n> 1See Glossary on page 3\n> 2Net debt was £18,009m at 31 March 2022\n> 3FTTP take up defined as customers that have been provisioned on the FTTP network\n> BT Group plc Registered Office: 1 Braham Street London E1 8EE Registered in England and Wales no. 4190816 www.bt.com/about\n\n# Overview of the nine months to 31 December 2022 \n\nCustomer-facing unit updates \n\nAdjusted 1 revenue Adjusted 1 EBITDA \n\nNine months to 31 December 2022 2021 Change 2022 2021 Change \n\n£m £m % £m £m %\n\nConsumer 7,431 7,442 — % 1,964 1,705 15 % \n\nEnterprise 3,692 3,867 (5) % 1,010 1,252 (19) % \n\nGlobal 2,474 2,525 (2) % 311 321 (3) % \n\nOpenreach 4,255 4,068 5 % 2,570 2,368 9 % \n\nOther 24 20 20 % 25 62 (60) % \n\nIntra-group items (2,296) (2,245) (2) % — — — % \n\nTotal 15,580 15,677 (1) % 5,880 5,708 3 % \n\nThird quarter to 31 December 2022 2021 Change 2022 2021 Change \n\n£m £m % £m £m %\n\nConsumer 2,439 2,585 (6) % 669 628 7 % \n\nEnterprise 1,253 1,295 (3) % 350 400 (13) % \n\nGlobal 857 871 (2) % 114 114 — % \n\nOpenreach 1,419 1,361 4 % 859 807 6 % \n\nOther 10 6 67 % 15 11 36 % \n\nIntra-group items (766) (749) (2) % — — — % \n\nTotal 5,212 5,369 (3) % 2,007 1,960 2 % \n\nConsumer: Strong performance in tough market conditions, first full quarter after completion of BT Sport JV • Revenue was flat due to the BT Sport disposal offsetting service revenue 1 growth; on a Sports JV pro forma 1\n\nbasis revenue was up 2%, with a 4% growth in service revenue 1 driven by the 2022 annual contractual price rise which was aided by a higher FTTP base, along with higher roaming, offset by lower mobile equipment sales due to reduced market activity • EBITDA was up 15% due to the BT Sport disposal and increased mobile and fixed service revenue 1 and tight cost management including lower indirect mobile commissions;

revenue excluding divestments, one-offs and foreign exchange was down 5%  \n\n> •\n\nEBITDA decline reflected lower revenue and inflationary pressures, partly offset by lower operating costs from ongoing modernisation, cost control and one-offs;

FTTP connections continue to grow • Revenue growth due to price increases and increased sales of fibre-enabled products and Ethernet, partially offset by decline in physical lines and decrease in chargeable repairs due to lower repair volumes • EBITDA growth from revenue flow through and lower operating costs driven by improved repair and efficiency programmes partially offset by higher FTTP provisioning activity, and pay inflation • Broadband base down 10k in Q3 (Q3 FY22: 45k growth) with YoY position impacted by reduced broadband market growth; competitor churn continues to be in line with our expectations and average monthly rental ARPU grew by c.£1 YoY (7.6%) due to increased volumes of FTTP • Record FTTP build of 810k premises passed in the quarter at an average build rate of 62k per week;

Adjusted results are consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and assist in providing an additional analysis of the reporting trading results of the group. \n\nEBITDA Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA EBITDA before specific items, share of post tax profits/losses of associates and joint ventures and net non-interest related finance expense. \n\nFree cash flow Net cash inflow from operating activities after net capital expenditure. \n\nCapital expenditure Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the period. \n\nNormalised free cash flow \n\nFree cash flow (net cash inflow from operating activities after net capital expenditure) after net interest paid and payment of lease liabilities, before pension deficit payments (including their cash tax benefit), payments relating to spectrum, and specific items. It excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends paid, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals, repayment and raising of debt, cash flows relating to loans with joint ventures, and cash flows relating to the Building Digital UK demand deposit account which have already been accounted for within normalised free cash flow. For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis. \n\nNet debt Loans and other borrowings and lease liabilities (both current and non-current), less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet. Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated into sterling at swapped rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method are removed. Amounts due to or from joint ventures held within current asset investments or loans and borrowings are also excluded. \n\nService revenue Earned from services delivered using our fixed and mobile network connectivity, including but not limited to, broadband, calls, line rental, TV, residential BT Sport subscriptions, mobile data connectivity, incoming & outgoing mobile calls and roaming by customers of overseas networks. \n\nSports JV pro forma On 1 September 2022 BT Group and Warner Bros. Discovery announced completion of their transaction to form a 50:50 joint venture (JV) combining the assets of BT Sport and Eurosport UK. Financial information stated as pro forma is unaudited and is presented to estimate the impact on the group as if trading in relation to BT Sport had been equity accounted for in previous periods, akin to the JV being in place historically. Please refer to the press release on 3 November 2022 for a bridge between financial information on a reported basis and a Sports JV pro forma basis at the half year to 30 September 2022. \n\nSpecific items Items that in management’s judgement need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. In the current period these relate to changes to our assessment of our provision for historic regulatory matters, restructuring charges, divestment-related items and net interest expense on pensions. \n\n3Our commentary focuses on the trading results on an adjusted basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group’s results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group’s financial performance as specific items are those that in management’s judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group. In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence. Reported revenue, reported operating costs, reported operating profit and reported profit before tax are the equivalent unadjusted or statutory measures. \n\nEnquiries \n\nPress office: Tom Engel Richard Farnsworth \n\nTel: 07947 711 959 Tel: 07734 776 317 \n\nInvestor relations: Mark Lidiard Tel: 0800 389 4909 \n\nWe will hold a conference call for analysts and investors in London at 10am today and a simultaneous webcast will be available at www.bt.com/results.
