The adjusted return on equity (ROAE) was 22.7%.

Contrary to the market trend, the area had a net inflow (NNM) of R$ 14.5 billion in the quarter and R$ 80.4 billion for the year, while the fund industry recorded withdrawals of R$ 137.8 billion in 2023 (Source: Anbima).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWealth Management & Consumer Banking reported record revenues for the 20th consecutive quarter, totaling R$ 862 million, a 26% increase compared to 4Q22, and R$ 3.1 billion for the year, a 21% increase compared to 2022.
