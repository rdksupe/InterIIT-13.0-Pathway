With effective ESG integration. 2022 \n\n# Annual Report 2Annual Report 2022 Partnership Letter GRI 2-22 \n\nIn 2022, we reaped the rewards of investments made over the past few years, which are now reaching maturity and reverting into recognition by our clients. \n\n3\n\n> Presentation\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n\nThe year 2022 was extraordinary for BTG Pactual. Our strategy of diversifying our product and service offerings in recent years, whether organically or through acquisitions, has proven to be quite successful. It has provided us with comfort and strength to maintain a high level of growth, despite the economic conditions both domestically and internationally. Our performance was strongly driven by the growth in client franchises, with expansion of assets under management and administration to R$ 1.3 trillion, an increase in credit and a surge in the volume transacted. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, with the prospect of lower global growth, high interest rates, the energy crisis in Europe, the economic slowdown in China and the election in Brazil, we reported record revenues and net income for the year of R$ 17.2 billion and R$ 8.3 billion, up 24% and 28% respectively. Our funding base also experienced robust growth in 2022, with an increase in the retail share. We remain focused on the quality of our service and delivering tailored solutions to our clients. primarily backed by technology. The solutions created by our team, for high income retail and for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), positively impacted other lines of business, which also benefited from these investments. None of this would be achievable without our unique Partnership model. It allows us to fully align the interests of our clients business partners, employees, and 317 partners, always with long-term vision and thinking. Still 2022, with the goal of providing the best service to our clients and supporting the continual growth of our business, we increased our staff by approximately 20%, from 4,900 to 5,999 employees, located in our bank\'s offices across 9 countries. Every team shares and promotes the goals, aspirations, and, especially, the culture of BTG on a daily basis. We remain steadfast in our goal of broadening our product offering to other regions, including Europe and the United States. This strategy is already being consolidated through international offices in Lisbon, London, Miami, and New York, as well as expansion strategies for offices in Luxembourg and Madrid in 2023. Our expansion is closely aligned with our ESG strategy. We understand that, in order to continue growing, it is essential to consider environmental, social, and governance aspects in all business lines as an integral part of the bank\'s daily routine. Due to the rigor that we treat this theme in addressing this matter, our decisions are designed to support clients in transitioning to a more sustainable, inclusive, and low-carbon economy. This journey is not always easy and we often face difficult decisions, but we recognize that this is what sets us apart from the rest of the market. We do not want to take the easy way out, but rather the path that provides real solutions to meet our clients\' needs, always considering ESG aspects. We will continue to grow and deliver tangible results, upholding our mission to build a bank that is more transparent, innovative, and accessible. Supporting our clients partners, and employees in their present moment and in building their story. \n\nAndré Esteves \n\nChairman of the Board of Directors \n\nRoberto Sallouti \n\nCEO of BTG Pactual 2022 Highlights R$ 1.3 trillion \n\nof assets under man-agement/administration (AuM/AuA) in 2022 \n\n# R$ 254 billion \n\nof Net New Money in 2022 \n\n# R$ 6.7 billion \n\nin issuances of sustainable debentures \n\n# R$ 4.4 billion \n\nin issuances of DCM Sustainable Debt \n\n# 62% \n\n# of the Corporate & SME Lending portfolio \n\nwith a more in-depth ESG analysis \n\n# 5,999 \n\nemployees in 9 countries \n\nFinancial Social, environmental and relationship \n\n4\n\n# R$ 17.2 billion \n\nvs R$ 13.9 billion in total revenue in 2021 \n\n# 24% growth \n\n# R$ 8.3 billion \n\nCredit portfolio eligible for the Sustainable Finance Framework \n\n# R$ 8.2 billion \n\nvs R$ 6.5 billion in net income in 2021 \n\n# 28% growth FTSE4Good \n\nLondon Stock Exchange \n\n# ISE B3 \n\nB3\'s Sustainability Index \n\n# ICO 2\n\nB3\'s Carbon Efficient Index \n\n# 100% \n\n# compensation of CO 2 emissions \n\ndirect and part of indirect from air travel, transportation and waste generated \n\n# 100% \n\n# of relationships \n\nassessed regarding environmental and social risks (Know Your Client) \n\n> Presentation ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n# Awards and recognition 2022 \n\nManagement Best Private Bank for Business Owners in the World Global Best Private Bank Latam Best Private Bank Brazil Best Private Bank Chile Best Private Bank Colombia Best Digital Bank in Latin America Best Private Bank for Use of Technology LatAm Best Private Bank for Digital Customer Service LatAm Best Private Bank LatAm Best Private Bank Brazil Best Private Bank Colombia \n\nWealth Management Bank of the Year \n\nBest Bank for New Financial Products Best Bank in Brazil \n\nBetter Application of Digital Transformation Initiatives Winner in the Digital Banks category Banking Tech Awards Best Digital Initiative – Launch of the New Bank/Brand \n\nBest Bank in Emerging Markets Best Bank in Brazil and LatAm Euromoney Best Bank for Advisory LatAm \n\nGlobal Latin America Brazil Chile Colombia Latin America Latin America and the Caribbean Global Brazil Brazil Brazil Brazil Latin America Latin America Latin America Brazil Colombia Global Latin America Latin America M&A House of the Year LatAm Investment Bank of the Year Latin America Latin America Best SME Bank in the World Best SME Bank in Brazil and Latin America Best Bank for New Financial Products in the World Global Best M&A Bank LatAm Best Investment Bank in Colombia World Finance Best Investment Bank Brazil World Finance Best Investment Bank Chile World Finance Best Investment Bank Colombia Global Latin America Global Latin America Latin America Latin America Latin America Latin America Bank of the Year in the Americas No 1 in growth, profitability, solidity, quality and leverage Latin America Brazil The Banker Coverage Global Finance Coverage Global Finance Euromoney PWM Latin Finance Global Finance Global Business Outlook 9 th CONAREC Award Fintech Futures Euromoney Latin Finance Coverage Coverage Coverage Coverage Coverage \n\nWealth Management Banking Institutional \n\nNo. 1 in Green Bonds No. 1 in Sustainable Finance No. 1 in Sustainable Bonds No. 1 in Transparency Latin America Latin America Latin America Latin America Latin America ESG Investment Initiative of the Year Environmental Finance – Sustainable Investments Awards Coverage Global Finance Coverage ESG & Impact Investing \n\nPresentation ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n\n56\n\n# Report profile \n\nThis Annual Report presents the operational, environmental, climate, social and economic performance of BTG Pactual from January 1 to December 31, 2022, the same period covered in its Financial Statements.

In addition, the report also indicates BTG Pactual\'s policies and practices that contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the targets of the 2030 Agenda.

These include public events, such as quarterly earnings conference calls, and major annual events, such as CEO Conference, Macro Day, AgroForum and the Annual Meeting of Investors (APIMEC).

The purpose of our recommended ESG portfolio is to assist our clients in their investment process by selecting 10 stocks of companies with a high ESG standard each month.

We believe our growth will be driven by the sophistication of the markets in which we operate, an increase in market share (particularly in Asset Management and Wealth Management), our expansion into different Latin American countries using the expertise gained from our Brazilian operations, ongoing technological evolution enabling us to expand our activities geographically, and our proficiency in quickly recognizing trends and opportunities, combined with our agile and capable internal structure, allowing us to offer new products and modern solutions. \n\nWe also plan to take advantage of opportunities to consolidate our franchises and leverage our standing among current and future Latin American and global clients. \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Competitive advantages \n\n18 \n\nWith a focus on the development of intellectual capital, meritocracy, and entrepreneurship, our Partnership model is characterized by a horizontal administrative structure, guided by autonomy and the alignment of interests. Unlike other Investment Bank and Asset Management institutions in Brazil and around the world that have gone public, we chose to implement a series of concrete measures to ensure that our Partnership model remained intact. Our integrated business model, characterized by the synergy and complementarity of our different business areas, enables us to provide a broad array of products and services. By doing so, we maximize our chances of broadening our client relationships, diversifying our operations and increasing our revenue sources. We appreciate the opportunities for cross selling enabled by the scope of our business areas and the power of our relationships. Over the past 40 years, BTG Pactual\'s performance in the international financial market has solidified our position as one of the leading Latin American institutions, providing opportunities to do business with key counterparts in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North America. We will continue seeking to strengthen our capillarity, promoting business and generating directional revenues in the international market. Due to our management\'s focus on combining healthy capital ratios and maintaining an appropriate risk profile, we have generated consistent returns for our shareholders and investors over multiple economic cycles, even in the face of difficult circumstances, consistently achieving positive financial and operational results. We are present in the major countries of Latin America and are one of the leaders in financial services in the region, which has immense business potential. With four decades of local experience, a strong capital base, and a horizontal administrative structure, we are able to quickly, accurately, and effectively identify and seize opportunities. Innovation is an essential tool for the ongoing development of our products, processes, and services. Therefore, we invest in developing innovative solutions that combine technology and humanized customer service, becoming more agile, reliable, and effective. Our commitment to environmental, social, and governance best practices is at the base of our operations, which are guided by a long-term vision and rigorous control of risks associated with our own activities as well as those of our clients. We integrate sustainability into our business strategy through initiatives that permeate the entire value chain. \n\n## History of strong growth and profitability ESG Practices Innovation Corporate culture Integrated business model Leadership in the Latin American market Global capillarity \n\n# Competitive advantages \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Technological evolution \n\n19 \n\nTechnology has been an essential tool to leverage our success in uncovering new opportunities in the financial market. Since 2014, we have been heavily investing in the infrastructure necessary for digital transformation, including migrating our entire banking ecosystem to the cloud and digitally onboarding our clients. \n\nIn addition to increasing operational efficiency, these investments enabled the development of numerous innovative solutions. One example was the bank\'s initial foray into high income retail in 2015, through a digital investment app that initially offered products such as investment funds and fixed income. In 2016, we launched BTG Pactual Digital, our most advanced and comprehensive online investment platform. After that, we had a succession of innovations, with highlight to Banking as a Service (BaaS), through which we started offering our own financial infrastructure to large international clients in 2020. The following year, we released transactional digital platforms for individuals and small to medium-sized companies. We also strive to operate in segments that are not currently being served by BTG Pactual. An example was the increase in our shareholding in Banco Pan 7, a publicly traded digital retail bank, with a focus on providing services and banking to the lower-income population, thereby expanding financial inclusion for this group (see more on page 95 ).

In addition, we aspire to be more than just financial advisors; we want to be a leading source of climate change advice in Latin America. To that end, we seek to guide our clients on ESG and climate agendas, helping them transition to a low-carbon economy, while also providing credit and promoting sustainable practices. By combining positive social and environmental impacts with a commitment to providing consistent returns to our clients, we are contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined by the United Nations (UN) in the 2030 Agenda. In addition to guiding the impact investments and social responsibility initiatives developed by the bank ( see details on page 110 ), the SDGs are taken into account in other aspects of the business strategy, so that the goals of the 2030 Agenda are increasingly integrated into the development of new products, services, and solutions. \n\n20 ESG & Impact Investing Management Structure Integrate ESG into BTG Pactual\'s strategy, business and activities through risk assessment and mitigation, as well as communication about the progress on this agenda.

The Impact Investing division has been strengthening this structure since 2020, connecting global investors to opportunities for sustainable investments in Latin America. By combining positive social and environmental impacts with consistent returns for clients, BTG Pactual contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations (UN) in the 2030 Agenda. In addition to guiding the impact investments and social responsibility initiatives developed by the bank, the SDGs are taken into account in other aspects of the business strategy, so that the goals of the 2030 Agenda are increasingly observed in the development of new products, services, and solutions. \n\n## Examples of impact investments 3-3 Material topic: Transparency Targets of the 2030 Agenda: 8.3 | 12.a \n\nIncreasing access to essential services, such as basic sanitation, through the issuance of Brazil\'s first Blue Bond by BRK Ambiental in October 2022.

The fund invests in companies that strive to create a positive and measurable social and/or environmental impact, seeking transactions that provide scalable solutions to urgent challenges while also providing solid financial returns. By 2022, three investments had been made through this fund. Gran Cursos, our first venture, seeks to broaden access to quality education through technology. It is one of the largest EdTechs (educational technology companies) offering online preparatory courses for public examinations, professional certifications, and postgraduate studies. Last year, Gran Cursos acquired SoulCode and Unibagozzi, broadening the business to technology education and undergraduate degrees. By positively impacting the lives of its students with high-quality education, it directly contributes to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 4 - Quality Education). Aliare 9, our second investment, expands the use of technology in the field, optimizing the efficient use of resources, improving agricultural management, and contributing to increased productivity and income for its clients, mostly small and medium-sized rural producers. By contributing to a more productive and sustainable agribusiness, it supports the fulfillment of SDG 2 (Zero Hunger and Sustainable Agriculture). In 2022, we made a third investment in Chilean BioElements, a bioplastics company, which provides an \n\n28 \n\nenvironmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastic. With the use of a new technology called BioE-8 Resin, composed of renewable and biodegradable materials, its product can decompose in a period of 6 to 20 months, compared to conventional plastic which can take up to 400 years to break down. The innovation enhances the circular economy model and supports the achievement of SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). GRI 2-6 d \n\nESG integration and impact management and measurement are guided by international references related to the topic, such as Operating Principles for Impact Management, Theory of Change, Impact Management Project (IMP), IRIS+ (GIIN), 2X Challenge, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, IFC Performance Standards, the Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Corporate Governance Framework. This work is also backed by a consulting firm with expertise in the topic. 9. At the time of the investment, the company was called Siagri, which had its brand changed to Aliare following its integration with Datacoper. \n\n## Other Strategies \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 For a few years now, BTG Pactual has been raising funds to reinforce its commitment to the ESG strategy: 1. In November 2020, we made our first green bond issuance for our Framework. The transaction was a private placement of US$ 50 million; 2. Agreement with DEG and Proparco, in December 2020, in the amount of US$ 140 million, for the purpose of financing operations that contribute to mitigating climate change; 3. In January 2021, we issued our first senior Green Bond to the market in the amount of US$ 500 million, at a fixed rate of 2.75% p.a. – the lowest rate practiced in the market by a Brazilian financial institution in an international placement; 4. In September of the same year, we signed an agreement with the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for US$ 300 million to expand the bank\'s services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Latin America; \n\n29   \n\n> 9.

Agreement with JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), in February 2022, to provide US$ 200 million to expand our SME activities; 6. Issuance of R$ 1.5 billion in the first phase of our sustainable CBD initiative. In November 2022, the Sustainable Financing Program celebrated its first anniversary, with a total of R$ 1.2 billion in sustainable deposits (CDBs and LFs) 9, allocated to finance and refinance projects in the categories of Renewable Energy (42%), Sanitation (36%) and Sustainable Agriculture (22%). The amount contributes to financing a portfolio of sustainable assets worth R$ 7.9 billion and 59 projects. Among the positive environmental impacts in the sectors funded are reductions in CO 2 emissions, increased installed capacity of renewable energy, improved sanitation infrastructure, and benefits to society such as increased access to potable water and sanitation, as outlined in the first allocation report of our Sustainable Financing Program. At the end of the year, these operations totaled R$ 6.7 billion in sustainable Unsecured Funding. With respect to the transactions highlighted in items 1and 3, in November 2022 we released our second Green Financing Report, an allocation report that shows how funds raised through our green instruments were used and the impact of the assets and projects financed during the period. Reviewed by Sustainalytics, the document outlines the conclusion of the distribution of the US$ 550 million raised through the Green Bond issued in January 2021 and the green Private Placement issued in November 2020. The balance allocated in 2022, accounting for approximately 29% of the total, funded 8 different renewable energy, water, and sanitation companies – in 2021, the 79% allocated funded 27 companies. The publication also outlines the positive impacts generated, such as a decrease in CO 2 emissions and an increase in installed renewable energy capacity, improved sanitation infrastructure, and expanded access to potable water ( to learn more on this topic, see the Operations and Performance chapter ). The operations referred to in paragraphs 1, 3 and 6 follow the eligibility criteria set forth in the Sustainable Financing Framework 10 ,related to assets and projects financed in renewable energy (such as solar and wind), energy efficiency, sanitation, clean transportation, sustainable buildings, sustainable forest management, low-carbon agriculture, resource efficiency and pollution prevention, affordable housing, affordable basic infrastructure, and financing for small and medium-sized companies 11 . The amount corresponding to all of these categories, excluding financing for SMEs, is referred to as an Eligible Portfolio, which was valued at R$ 8.2 billion in 2022. This balance saw a reduction of around 20% compared to 2021, due to the expiration of operations that were eligible. \n\n# Evolution of sustainable finance ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Responsible conduct ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n\n30 31 \n\nSince BTG Pactual was founded in 1983, we have been striving to enhance our corporate governance in order to ensure an adequate and efficient structure that, on the one hand, supports senior management and, on the other, ensures broad alignment with the interests of shareholders, clients, and other stakeholders. All members of the Board of Directors fulfill their role in a way that is integrated with the culture of BTG Pactual, through a robust structure of advisory bodies and collective decisions. Part of this vision is the Partnership model that has contributed to the company\'s results in recent years. Under this management model, senior partners are responsible for administration, engaging in the best business decisions and being driven by meritocracy. As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership included 317 partners 1,jointly (directly or indirectly) holding 67.8% of the share capital. Additionally, our high standard of governance is derived from the adoption of the recommendations of the Brazilian Corporate Governance Code 2 , which is required for companies listed on Level 2 of the B3, which take additional actions beyond those mandated by law. Thus, we reaffirm our commitment to the best practices in the market with regards to ethical principles, transparency, and compliance (for detailed information on rights and benefits granted to BTG Pactual shareholders, visit our Investor Relations website). The bank also has a Corporate Governance Policy, which includes important principles for risk management.

To that end, we adopt awareness and control mechanisms, such as guidelines and programs that are shared with our key stakeholders – employees, busi-ness partners, and clients. We maintain rigorous internal and external audit processes, as well as channels through which we inform, guide and receive complaints. The BTG Code of Conduct is the document that serves as the founda-tion for ethical behavior throughout the BTG Pactual Group, applicable to all employees from interns to the CEO and board members in a comple-mentary and integrated manner. Similarly, ethics permeate programs and other corporate policies, such as the Integrity Program, the Anti-Money Laundering Program, the Compliance Manual, and the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy.

BTG Pactual reorganized its compliance and corporate integrity structure in 2016, aiming to strengthen its internal control sys-tem and align with global best practices. This has resulted in an updated and inno-vative structure, with employees who are responsible for ensuring the bank\'s com-pliance. We emphasize the involvement of leaders like Nelson Jobim, responsible for Institutional Relations and Compliance Policies, and Mariana Cardoso, Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). The Compliance Committee, a non-statu-tory body guided by the Internal Regula-tions approved by the Board of Directors on January 2, 2019, is responsible for BTG Pactual\'s Integrity Program, with the su-pport of the compliance team. The Integrity Program aims to establish me-chanisms to prevent, detect, and rectify any activity that is not in compliance with the Bank\'s Code of Conduct, as well as to guide BTG Pactual\'s operational routine and the actions of employees, third parties, su-ppliers, and other business partners. \n\n# Integrity Program \n\nTargets of the 2030 Agenda: 16.5; 16.6 GRI 2-24 Ethics and integrity \n\n## BTG Pactual Code of Conduct Support from Senior Management \n\n01 \n\n> Endorsement and backing from BTG\'s senior management.\n\nCode of Conduct and Compliance Policies \n\n02 \n\n> Evaluation of partners, representatives and other third parties\n\nDue Diligence \n\n03 \n\nRisk Assessment \n\n04 \n\nInternal Controls \n\n05 \n\nReporting Channels \n\n06 07 \n\nAudit and Monitoring \n\n08 09 \n\nInternal Investigations Training and communication Formalization of BTG\'s attitude towards business practices Analysis of events with negative impacts on BTG\'s objectives Mechanisms to minimize risks and ensure that accounting and financial records reflect BTG\'s business Ways to alert BTG to violations of the Code of Conduct and laws Investigations to address allegations of illegal or unethical behavior Internal and external processes for verifying the functioning of the Integrity Program Training for the employee to understand the objectives, regulations, and their role in ensuring the success of the Integrity Program. \n\nINTEGRITY PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS \n\nAccess the Code of Conduct here \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 37 \n\nThe main objective of the Compliance committee is to assist the Board of Directors in the management and oversight of regulatory and reputational risks.

On 03/04/2022, the plaintiff was summoned to regularize its own procedural representation, under penalty of dismissal of the case, and the plaintiff\'s petition seeking said representation is pending review. The lawsuit has already been contested by the defendants and is awaiting processing for a response. In 2022, the analogous process initiated by Petrobras S.A. against nine banks, including BTG Pactual, for alleged cartel activity in exchange transactions conducted between 2008 and 2012 resulted in a decision of dismissal without merit being published on 01/24/2023. Petrobras subsequently filed an appeal on 02/13/2023, which is awaiting referral to the TJSP. Furthermore, the Brazilian Foreign Trade Association (AEB) has filed a public civil suit against 29 financial institutions. On 02/24/2022, aruling was issued dismissing the suit without a ruling on the merits due to the initial complaint being denied (lack of legal interest to bring a public civil suit). The plaintiff has filed an appeal and is attempting to serve summons to the defendants/ appellants, some of whom have addresses only overseas, in order to respond to the appeal. We will report the outcome of these proceedings in the year in which they are subject to afinal, non-appealable decision, in accordance with our commitment to transparency.

Our risk management structure is composed of the Risks and Capital Committee, which supports the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and the Executive Board in making strategic decisions for the bank .\n\nThe Risks and Capital Committee advises the Board of Directors in overseeing the company\'s tolerance in risk taking, as well as in managing financial, capital, and operational risks, including market, credit, and liquidity risks, as well as socio-environmental and climate risks. GRI 2-12 \n\nThe Risks and Capital Committee convenes quarterly to review integrated reports and discuss all pertinent matters. At least once a year, or as needed, the members of the Risks and Capital Committee make recommendations to the Board of Directors about the Risk Management structure. GRI 2-12 \n\nBTG Pactual\'s risk management process follows the principles described in our Corporate Governance Policy. GRI 2-19 Management responsibility \n\nSenior executives are partners and have a substantial portion of their personal assets invested in the Institution, demonstrating a long-term commitment to risk management. \n\nIndependent controls \n\nControl functions are responsible for objective and independent verification of risk exposure. \n\nRisk disclosure \n\nThe transparent and objective disclosure of risk exposure to senior management — Board of Directors, Compliance Committee, Audit Committee, Risks and Capital Committee —, to the ESG Committee and to shareholders, regulators, rating agencies and other employees is a fundamental part of the risk control and management process. \n\nProtection of financial condition and income \n\nOur daily controls are designed to mitigate negative outcomes, safeguarding the bank from stress events by implementing limits assigned to the risks we face. To further enhance these operational controls, we strategically monitor and restrict our exposure to overall risk, taking into account the various risks associated with all types of businesses. \n\nReputation protection \n\nWe take a prudent approach to any risks that cannot be accurately evaluated or reasonably priced. \n\nGRI 2-19 \n\n## Risk management process Risk analysis Yes No Risk mapping Risk assessment Risk monitoring Mapping of the risks and their respective origins Discussion of the possibility of mitigating the identified risks Analysis of the sufficiency of capital available to tackle the identified risks Simulation of the impact in stressed scenarios and definition of limits (if relevant) Monitoring of the evolution of the risks through reports and internal controls to promote transparency and foster organizational awareness.

Impact assessment and, where relevant, quantitative analysis Creation of management policies together with the Risk Committee 47 47 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Market risk \n\nLosses resulting from adverse changes in the prices of risk components. Mitigation : all market risk arising from trading activities or any other business area is identified, measured, monitored, and controlled to safeguard the bank from undesirable exposures. \n\nCredit risk \n\nCredit Risk consists of the potential for losses associated with the borrower or counterparty\'s failure to meet their financial obligations as agreed, the devaluation of the contract due to a decrease in the borrower\'s risk rating, and the reduction of profits or remuneration. Credit risk is an inherent part of loan activities and can be found in some derivatives products and certain structured transactions. Mitigation : we apply the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program and Client Identification Program (CIP) to potential clients, as well as background checks and Credit Risk Control (CRC) analysis. \n\nOperational risk \n\nLosses resulting from internal process, personnel, and system failures, deficiencies, or inadequacies, or from external events. \n\nMitigation : the multiple risks inherent in our processes are identified and managed to minimize operational losses. \n\nLiquidity risk \n\nOccurrence of a discrepancy between payment and receipt flows, which could result in failure to fulfill commitments and obligations assumed. Mitigation : control and management are accomplished through a set of practices established by the Liquidity Risk Management Policy, approved and reviewed regularly by the Management Committee and the Board of Directors. \n\nRisk of contagion \n\nLosses resulting from the occurrence of adverse events in affiliated companies and/or with significant equity holdings. Mitigation : the group companies operate in an integrated fashion with controls and processes for risk monitoring. \n\nConcentration risk \n\nOccurrence of credit portfolios being concentrated in a few borrowers, which means that few defaults are enough to affect the solvency and future viability of the institution. This is also known as risk due to lack of portfolio granularity. Mitigation : the risk is controlled by the Group Controlling area and tracked in a consolidated manner for the institutions within the prudential conglomerate by economic group and by sector. \n\nSocial, environmental and climate risks \n\nLoss or damage resulting from socio-environmental irregularities. Mitigation : 100% of our relationships undergo socio-environmental and climate risk analysis, the depth and topics of which vary depending on the counterparty\'s relationship with the bank, the sector in which it operates, and the type of transaction. \n\nImage/reputational risk \n\nLosses due to internal practices, risk events, and external factors that could adversely affect the company\'s reputation in the market. Mitigation :the Communication & Marketing, Compliance, and Internal Audit areas actively monitor this type of risk. Passively, it is the responsibility of each employee to consider the reputation of the institution while conducting all activities. \n\nLegal Risk \n\nLosses arising from fines, penalties or indemnities resulting from actions of supervisory and control bodies, as well as losses arising from unfavorable decision in judicial and administrative proceedings. Mitigation : the Legal area maps, controls, and prevents this risk, providing support to all business and administrative areas of the bank. \n\nCyber risk \n\nExternal and internal threats to the information technology infrastructure that can impact the processing of financial information, such as theft/violation of digital assets or intellectual property, attempted intrusions, unauthorized access to information, non-compliance with data privacy laws, and more. Mitigation : we promote the continuous advancement of our defense structure, at a pace that keeps up with the development of cyber risks and threats, to enhance our resilience to attacks and reduce our vulnerabilities, as well as respond to incidents efficiently. \n\n# Main risks monitored by BTG Pactual \n\n48 48 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\nAll of BTG Pactual\'s relationships and transactions undergo a socio-environmental due diligence process based on the principles of relevance and proportionality. This process is conducted through the Environmental, Social and Governance Management System (ESGMS), which is structured transversally throughout the institution. GRI 2-12 | G4-FS2 \n\n# Social, environmental and climate risk management \n\nFor each line of business and sector of the economy, the ESGMS specifically addresses ESG risk, ensuring that it is identified, assessed, classified, monitored, and mitigated appropriately. G4-FS2 \n\nKYC analyses are primarily conducted through automated systems, such as the Delfos System, which have an extensive public database of socio-environmental and climate risks and standardized rules of identification of findings specifically applicable to each type of relationship. If any discrepancies are identified with the BTG Pactual Code of Business Principles and Ethics, Social, Environmental and Climate Responsibilities Policy, and other internal procedures and policies, the ESG and AML areas are automatically called to manually analyze the case, depending on the related topic. Both areas have veto and approval power, and double approval is required to continue the relationship.

These standards are tools that enable us to identify the socio-environmen-tal and climate risks and impacts in our loans and investment operations, and, if applicable, create an action plan to be implemented by the client in order to prevent, mitigate, and/ or offset the identified impacts and risks. The ESG area and business units are res-ponsible for identifying these operations, and the former is responsible for technical analysis and monitoring of the client\'s com-pliance. \n\n## IFC Performance Standards \n\nScope Obligation \n\n> 4.

Therefore, we identified which sectors were the most material to BTG Pactual and developed 19 specific policies to identify these risks and good practices to guide our relationship with individuals or businesses involved in these sectors. The policies have been developed in accordance with the best market practices and IFC guidelines and should be applied throughout the BTG Pactual conglomerate. GRI 2-25 \n\n## Sectoral policies \n\nG4-FS1 \n\nAccess our sectoral policies here. \n\n51 51 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 The decision regarding any type of relationship with any counterparty occurs along the following lines of defense (in this order): ESG team, ESG Head, Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), and ESG Committee. If it is found that the counterparty is not able to adequately manage the socio-environmental and climate risks associated with its activities, the ESG area may recommend an action plan to be implemented by the counterparty in order to mitigate these risks – in some cases, this includes hiring an independent engineer or socio-environmental consultant to monitor the activities and adherence to the action plan, through regular reports on the environmental conditions and climate risks related to the operation. GRI 2-12 | G4-FS2 The approval of the operation depends on the commitment of the counterparty to execute this plan, which will be included in the operation\'s contracts and monitored. G4-FS2 | G4-FS3 \n\nFor these specific cases, in addition to the standard ESG clauses, we include clauses requiring adherence to the plan and early termination of the contract in the event of non-compliance. We can also include mandatory compliance clauses to authorize the disbursement of resources. Depending on the issues identified in the socio-environmental and climate analysis, there is still the possibility of including clauses for good practices and/or regularizing situations of lesser importance. All these points are monitored by the ESG team throughout the exposure, and, if necessary, by an external consulting firm. G4-FS2 | G4-FS3 \n\nThe periodicity and scope of the monitoring will be defined based on the analyses of the socio-environmental and climate impacts and risks of each of the projects. The frequency of follow-ups must not exceed one year. Monitoring may include a field visit, to be conducted by the ESG area and/or an independent socio-environmental consultant. G4-FS3 The highest governance body\'s role in engaging with counterparties occurs indirectly through the ESG Committee, which works in coordination with the Risks and Capital and Audit Committees. All approvals/denials made by the CSO are reported to the ESG Committee and documented. GRI 2-12 | GRI 2-13 \n\n# Relationship and lines of defense \n\n52 52 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 References \n\nWe are committed to the promotion and protection of human rights, in compliance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the voluntary commitments to which we are signatories, such as the Global clients. We demonstrate our commitment through the relationships we build with our employees, clients, business partners, suppliers, communities, and other stakeholders we interact with. GRI 2-23 | GRI 409 3-3 \n\nWe implement a series of policies and procedures to identify and prevent human rights risks across our value chain, including due diligence processes and corporate client monitoring. We understand that our greatest risk in terms of human rights is associated with the potential non-compliance of applicable legislation and/or international treaties and agreements on human rights by our clients, particularly those to whom we provide some form of financing or investment. GRI 2-23 | GRI 409 3-3 \n\nTherefore, in the KYC procedure, conducted for 100% of the bank\'s relationships, an automated internet search is performed, combining words such as "pornography", "prostitution", "child labor" and "slave labor", to verify if the counterparties are involved in any cases or processes of human rights violations. Additionally, we consult the registry of Employers who have subjected workers to conditions analogous to slavery, published by the Ministry of Economy. We also share a booklet on child labor with our clients, which outlines definitions of what constitutes child labor and the procedures to be adopted if it is found in their activities. Upon completion of the reading, the client must accept the terms outlined in the booklet. We monitor, throughout the relationship, relevant irregularities related to human rights violations. We include, in all our contracts, especially those related to investments and financing, clauses on the regularity and promotion of human rights, under penalty of early termination of the agreement, fines, and indemnities. GRI 2-25 | GRI 409 3-3 \n\nWe understand that the risks of child labor and forced labor are more susceptible to be present in the supply chain of the agricultural sector. When we conduct operations with this sector, we thoroughly evaluate the management of critical suppliers and also if the company has policies, programs, and metrics to manage the topic 5 . GRI 408-1 | GRI 409-1 \n\n## Human rights \n\nBTG Pactual condemns any form of exploitation of people through labor – compulsory, forced, sexual, slave, or child – as well as any form of discrimination. \n\nFortnightly review of the list of forced labor \n\nEvery two weeks, an internal system searches the client database to identify whether any individuals or legal entities are present on the updated list of forced labor. The objective of the search is to identify whether, after the start of the relationship with the bank, the counterparty was added to the Registry of Employers who maintained workers in a situation analogous to slavery. 100% of BTG Pactual\'s agreements and contracts have clauses that protect and promote human rights, and automatically expire in the event of a final, binding court decision on the matter. Furthermore, they are submitted to evaluation. \n\nGRI 2-25 | GRI 408-1 | GRI 409 3-3 | GRI 409-1 | GRI 308-1 \n\n> 5. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the geographic areas with the highest risk of conditions analogous to slavery in 2022 were Minas Gerais, followed by Goiás, Piauí, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo.\n\n53 53 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Forest management \n\nGRI 413 3-3 | GRI 413-1 \n\nThe management of our forest assets on properties managed by BTG Pactual group companies, is covered by assessments of socioeconomic impacts and risks throughout the operational stages, through a participatory process involving stakeholders. GRI 413-1 \n\nThe process begins with a mapping of the communities in the vicinity of the management areas, which generates a local socioeconomic diagnosis and identifies whether they are traditional or rural. This characterization involves consulting official databases (such as those of Funai and the Palmares Foundation), as well as non-governmental organizations or institutes that work with these populations. Frequent visits to communities are intended to keep the diagnosis up-to-date, monitor the impacts, and implement socio-environmental programs to help foster local development. \n\nGRI 2-25 | GRI 413-1 .\n\n## Forestry Dialogue Program \n\nGRI 413-1 \n\nA schedule for visiting the neighbors and local leaders in the areas surrounding the management units is established, within a 1 km radius of the properties with harvesting and transportation operations. It includes three stages: before, during and after activities. Prior communication is preferably conducted in person, using a questionnaire to assess family composition and gauge the perception of potential impacts during the activities. Follow-up during management is conducted periodically via telephone. After the completion of activities, a phone call is made to verify if there were any unaddressed needs during the harvesting and transportation operations. \n\n## Stage-wise assessments \n\nGRI 413-1 Pre-acquisition \n\nA socio-environmental assessment of the property, conducted prior to the acquisition of the forest asset, with the aim of identifying the major liabilities and impacts in order to determine actions and responsibilities between the buyer and seller. \n\nPost-acquisition \n\nComprehensive study of the environmental impact of the venture to obtain the necessary environmental licensing, as required by state law. Identification and monitoring of areas of high conservation value and operational activities with potential to cause environmental impact. \n\nAssessments are part of the environmental control programs and/or monitoring and control methodologies for each identified impact. These measures are compiled in the Environmental Aspects and Impacts Matrix, which guides the mitigation techniques and specific operational procedures to be implemented in the various activities. Annually, a Public Summary of the Management Plan, with environmental, social, operational, and worker health and safety indicators, is made available to the public on the BTG Pactual website. GRI 413-1 \n\nTo further facilitate communication with the community, we maintain an updated database of all stakeholders impacted by our forest management activities and provide multiple channels for communication (toll-free number 0800, email, WhatsApp and website), as well as a dedicated dialogue program.

Therefore, privacy is a matter to which we assign the highest priority. GRI 418 3-3 \n\nBTG Pactual safeguards the privacy of its clients\' and employees\' data, implementing the necessary mechanisms to guarantee their protection. As such, we guarantee that there are no negative impacts on data privacy as a result of our activities. Given the sensitivity of the processing of personal data, we have adopted a series of measures to ensure the privacy and protection of our clients\' information, such as the adoption of specific contractual clauses and due diligence on suppliers and privacy and data protection tools. These include data leak prevention (DLP) tools that reinforce its security. GRI 418 3-3 \n\nThere are different ways of conducting the process to identify vulnerabilities in our data protection systems, such as through vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. The Security Office team regularly conducts vulnerability assessments on servers, workstations and network assets to identify any existing vulnerabilities and alert the relevant teams to take the necessary action. The applications also undergo code review and penetration tests, the results of which are communicated to the developers, who must address any identified weaknesses in accordance with the established SLA. Our Threat Intelligence team, which is part of the Cyber Defense Center, is also actively working to identify zero-days and new threats that could exploit weaknesses in BTG Pactual. The Operational Risk area coordinates business continuity testing at least once a year. FN-CB-230a.2 Furthermore, we have a team to respond to requests from data subjects, we maintain a record of personal data processing activities in our data privacy tool and we conduct periodic reviews of the privacy program, with the aim of ensuring its continuous updating. We also have legal support in potential cases of security incidents and cybersecurity insurance. \n\n# Data privacy and protection \n\nIn 2022, BTG Pactual did not file any complaints of data privacy violations. \n\nGRI 418-1 \n\nThere was no case of a data breach.

GRI 418 3-3 \n\nWe provide information security training for Autonomous Agents (AAIs) on the BTG Bankers platform. In order to support the AAI offices, BTG Pactual has provided, free of charge, licenses for two information security tools: one for antivirus and another for data leak prevention. \n\nWe hold annual training focused on the LGPD and data privacy, which are mandatory for our employees. They are instructed to report any suspected security incidents, whether they involve personal data or not, through our communication channels. Training contemplated 95% of employees in 2022. Recently, a law firm conducted an evaluation of BTG Pactual\'s compliance with the LGPD. Points of improvement were identified and action plans were created to address the pertinent recommendations, leading to the adoption of preventive security measures to protect information and the implementation of data privacy processes and mechanisms to guarantee compliance. The governance team is responsible for implementing the action plans and responding to data subject requests, refining the flow. GRI 418 3-3 \n\nIn January 2023, BTG Pactual achieved ISO 27001 certification, which further strengthens our best practices in Information Security. One of the initiatives to mitigate the potential risk of data in documents left on printers received a score of 10 in the ISO 27001 certification process – requested in the second half of 2022 and obtained in January 2023 ( see the Printer Control case to the side ). Following the identification of a potential information security risk, the IT Customer Services area implemented a badge/ password printing system using radio frequency identification technology in 120 printers located in the offices of BTG Pactual, BTG Advisors, and Necton in Brazil. A smart system releases the print orders using a badge/password reader to identify the requesting employee. If the prints are not collected within one hour, the requests will be automatically cancelled. The initiative contributed to an estimated reduction of 297 thousand sheets (27% of the printing volume), reducing the risk of potential confidential information leakage and resulting in savings of over R$ 30 thousand. This action was a differential and contributed to the ISO 27001 certification process. \n\n## Printer control deployed in 2022 B&W Color \n\n> Total\n> 928,760 169,368\n> 1,098,128\n> 665,460 135,248\n> 800,708\n> 28% 20%\n> 27%\n> 263,300 34,120\n> 297,420\n> R$ 18,431.00 R$ 11,942.00\n> R$ 30,373.00\n> Sheets sent Sheets printed Sheets canceled % printing cancelled Financial savings Type\n> SAVINGS\n\n57 57 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\nOur operations provide the opportunity to engage with different sectors of the economy, fostering a sense of responsibility to promote and spread the best ESG practices.

Another major factor that affected the global economic scenario was the new wave of Covid-19, with the omicron variant, exacerbating global supply bottlenecks and hindering China\'s growth in the year. At the end of the year, however, there were some slight signs of improvement, such as the deceleration of U.S. inflation, the rise in economic activity in Europe, and the anticipation of the Chinese economy\'s reopening. Throughout 2022, U.S. economic and job market indicators remained at high levels, despite the Federal Reserve\'s (Fed, Central Bank of the United States) commitment to combat inflation through a restrictive monetary policy. Although the CPI retreated and presented bearish surprises at the end of the year, the strong job market should still lead to price increases, keeping inflation above the target set by the Fed. Europe, in turn, faced restrictions on gas supplies by Russia, driving up the price of energy and exacerbating the already existing inflationary pressures on the continent, in addition to hampering its economic growth. To combat inflation, the European Central Bank (ECB) promoted interest rate hikes throughout the year, making the European continent vulnerable to a recession. Marginally, at the end of the year, gas price stability bolstered the prospects for the region\'s economic activity level. Regardless, the ECB has kept its promise to raise interest rates, as the price increase remains high and widespread. In the early months of 2022, inflation was still affected by the bottlenecks in global production chains that had formed during the pandemic, as well as by the pass-through of foreign exchange and higher commodity prices, with inflationary pressures exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, impacting the industrial goods, food, and fuels segments. Simultaneously, the resumption of economic activity and the resurgence of the job market, driven by the ongoing process of reopening the economy and fiscal incentives, caused considerable inflationary pressures in the services sector. During 2Q22, the first signs of inflation cooling began to become apparent in the industrial goods segment, with the start of normalization in production chains, a slight appreciation of the exchange rate, and the completion of the cost pass-through process, leading to a moderation of inflation, particularly for durable goods. \n\n## The beginning of 2022 was marked by inflationary pressures stemming from adverse shocks abroad. \n\n60 60 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 In 3Q22, significant cuts in federal and state taxes on fuel, electricity and communication services resulted in three consecutive months of deflation in the IPCA. At the same time, signs of a slowdown in industrial inflation intensified, and services inflation also showed the first signs of moderation. Consequently, the second half of the year was marked by a moderation of inflationary pressures on the most economically sensitive segments, thus indicating a significant improvement in the composition of current inflation. However, the fiscal scenario that emerged from the discussions about the Transition PEC in December raised doubts about the possibility of inflation converging to the midpoint of the long-term targets, leading to a new round of worsening inflation expectations, despite the short-term inflationary outlook improving. \n\n## Economic scenario \n\nAgainst the economic backdrop, the stronger-than-expected growth seen in the last quarter of 2021 was abruptly halted in early 2022, with the first few months of the year indicating that the industry was still having difficulty recovering from the effects of the pandemic. However, a robust recovery in the job market indicated stronger activity in the second half of 2022, even as risks continued to rise into 2023 due to the weakening of global economic activity, persistent inflation, and increasingly restrictive financial conditions. In the final phase of last year, the GDP showed growth below our expectations in the third quarter, signaling that the Brazilian economy is in a process of deceleration stronger than the numbers indicated and should continue in this cooling process in the disclosure of the fourth quarter GDP, closing the year 2022 with growth of 3.0%. Thus, despite the promising outlook for the agricultural sector and the expectation of further fiscal stimulus in 2023, the deteriorating financial conditions, with an anticipated rise in the real interest rate, have caused us to revise our projections for economic activity in the coming years downward. \n\n## Fiscal scenario \n\nOn the fiscal side, 2022 was marked by an improvement in short-term figures. The combination of increased economic growth, suppressed inflation, higher commodity prices, and higher dividend payments from state-owned companies (primarily Petrobras and BNDES) resulted in a significant increase in revenue, leading to a considerably better primary result and public debt than anticipated at the start of the year. At the same time, a series of measures were approved that undermined the credibility of the Brazilian fiscal framework for subsequent years, such as the exemption of federal taxes on fuels (PIS/Cofins and Cide), the Benefits PEC (which ended up creating/ expanding a series of difficult-to-reverse benefits) and the Transition PEC (which could lead to an expansion of federal expenses of up to R$ 170 billion in 2023). PLP 18/22 was also passed, which created a space for the revenue of subnational entities to be jeopardized, by permanently capping the ICMS of fuels, electricity, communication services, and public transportation. \n\n61 61 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n## Exchange rate and balance of payments \n\nIn 2022, there was also a high degree of exchange rate volatility, driven by both external factors (such as a strong aversion to risk in global markets) and internal factors (such as the election and the approval of the Aid PEC). Even though, at the end of 2022, the expectation of the terminal interest rate in the US had decreased and the prices of commodities traditionally exported by Brazil had remained relatively stable (which would act towards the appreciation of the domestic currency), the perception of fiscal risk contributed to depreciate the exchange rate, which ended the year at R$ 5.29/US$. Looking at the Balance of Payments data, there was a strong influx of dollars through Direct Investment in the Country, more than enough to finance the current account deficit. In 2022, for example, the current account deficit amounted to US$ 55.7 billion, while the Direct Investment in the Country was US$ 90.6 billion. Another noteworthy achievement for the external sector was the all-time high of the balance of trade in the year: US$ 62.3 billion, with the maintenance of exports and imports at high levels throughout 2022. While foreign sales were largely focused on commodities, the most imported categories over the course of the year were intermediate goods, fuels, and lubricants. \n\n## Monetary policy \n\nThe year 2022 proved challenging when it came to conducting monetary policy. The first challenge encountered was the persistent and widespread increase in inflation, exacerbated by external factors (supply restrictions caused by the geopolitical conflict in Eastern Europe) and the strong performance of the domestic economy, partly due to the post-pandemic reopening. Throughout the year, Copom sought to reaffirm its commitment to bring inflation to the target, always signaling that it would raise the interest rate if necessary. In fact, important interest rate hikes occurred in the months of February, March, May, June and August, leaving the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. Although the September minutes expressed confidence that the monetary tightening conducted would be enough to combat inflation, the deteriorating fiscal prospects due to uncertainty about the new fiscal adjustment rules – our expectation for the new government – caused our cycle of decreasing interest rates to move towards a more distant and modest trajectory, only toward the end of 2023. Faced with the uncertain landscape, Copom noted the need for vigilance and perseverance in its December minutes, taking an even firmer stance in its first communiqué of 2023, with a close eye on the future developments in fiscal policy. \n\n62 62 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n## Political and economic scenario \n\nThe year 2022 was marked by politics. In the first half of the year, the highlight was the elaboration of a new proposal for a Constitution by the constitutional convention. The final proposal, submitted on July 4, included drastic changes compared to the existing constitution, significantly reducing the role of the market in the economy. In addition, President Gabriel Boric took office in March. The newly elected government openly endorsed the proposed Constitution and outlined a comprehensive agenda of political reforms. However, the constitutional proposal was rejected by 62% of voters in the historic referendum held on September 4th, with 13 million people (86% of eligible voters) participating. The significant outcome of the referendum, combined with the lack of a majority in Congress, led the new government to temper its reform agenda, including those related to taxes and pensions, which are currently being debated in Congress. In addition, the political parties agreed to a new process for drafting the Constitution, which established 12 unalterable constitutional foundations and included the formation of a commission of constitutional experts appointed by Parliament and a Constitutional Council elected under Senate rules. This proposal, which must still be ratified by Congress, significantly reduces the risk of a populist constitutional project. Economic uncertainty – as measured by the Central Bank of Chile (BCCh) – has consistently decreased since the September referendum, reaching its lowest point on November 19. In terms of economic activity, based on the data available as of November 22, we estimate that GDP growth was around 2.6/2.7%. The resources resulting from three consecutive pension fund withdrawals in 2020/2021 and the large transfers in the second half of 2021 bolstered private consumption during 1Q21. As households\' excess liquidity was depleted, private consumption began to decline from its unsustainable high level in the second quarter of 2022, and has been decreasing on a quarterly basis since then. However, this adjustment has been gradual, leading us to estimate that private consumption grew 2.9% in 2022. Regarding investment, according to 3Q22 data, we estimate that fixed investment increased 3.1% in the year. According to BCCh, the growth in investment has been driven by projects in the renewable energy sector, as well as engineering works associated with the final stages of mining projects, among others. On the external side, the macroeconomic imbalance caused mainly by the 2021 and early 2022 consumption boom was reflected in the current account deficit, which increased to 9.9% of the GDP in the third quarter of 2022. \n\nThe economic uncertainty caused by the new Constitution proposed on July 4th has decreased since its rejection in the September referendum, reaching its lowest point in November. \n\n# Chile \n\n63 63 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n## Inflation and fiscal scenario \n\nConsidering inflation, the consumption boom in 2021 and early 2022, stemming from three successive withdrawals from pension funds and massive tax transfers in the second half of 2021, increased internal inflationary pressures. In addition, external pressures were also high due to issues in the global supply chain, high maritime freight rates, the depreciation of the Chilean peso (CLP), and, most significantly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which caused an incre-ase in food and merchandise prices in 2022. These factors propelled inflation to a peak of 14.1% in August, which then gradually de-creased and closed the year at 12.8%, its hi-ghest annual rate in three decades. The combination of high levels of domestic demand and increasing inflation prompted the BCCh to raise the interest rate (MPR) from 4% in December 2021 to 11.25% in October 2022, a level that has been main-tained since then. In its December report, the BCCh stated that the MPR will remain at 11.25% until the inflation convergence to 3% is firmly established, which we do not anti-cipate to occur before the second quarter of 2023. Public accounts experienced significant improvement in 2022. Revenues exceeded expectations last year due to an increased payment of income tax and value-added tax (VAT). In addition, the revenues from lithium exploration contracts with SQM and Albermarle have contributed to impro-ving public finances. On the expenditure side, the termination of the large-scale tax transfers in 2021 resulted in a reduction of approximately 25% of spending, in real terms, in 2022. With this, we anticipate that the year will end with a primary surplus of 1.6-1.8% of the GDP and a public debt of 36% of the GDP. \n\n## Factors such as new lithium exploration contracts and the rise in income tax and Value-Added Tax have resulted in a significant improvement in public accounts in 2022. \n\n64 64 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n## Inflation and fiscal scenario \n\nTackling inflation was one of the most daunting challenges for the Colombian economy in 2022. Throughout the year, inflation projections were consistently surpassed, resulting in heightened expectations. The inflation rate for the year was 13.12% p.a., with a staggering food inflation rate of 27.9% p.a. The government attempted to control energy price hikes, but this was outweighed by the other inflationary factors. Even with a restrictive monetary policy, inflation still rose from 5.6% to 13.12% p.a., due to unfavorable supply shocks and increases in commodity prices, as well as excessive domestic demand. As a result, throughout 2022, the Banco de La República (Banrep, the Colombian central bank) opted to accelerate the pace of interest rate hikes, ranging from 100 to 150 basis points per meeting, ending the year at 12% (compared to 3% in 2021). At its most recent meeting held in January 2023, Banrep declared that the current interest rate would be sufficient to lower inflation. As a result of a higher-than-expected GDP performance, the current account deficit significantly worsened in 2022. The reduction in our estimate of 6.3% of the GDP is mainly due to a 35% increase in imports, which was not offset by an improved performance of the main Colombian exports (oil and coal). On the fiscal front, the deficit dropped to 5.5% (from 7.1% in 2021), which was partially achieved due to a 30% rise in revenues. The government has also successfully secured Congressional approval for a tax reform, which is projected to increase revenue by 1.2% of the GDP in the future. In order to reduce the gasoline subsidy in the country, the government has begun monthly increments in the price of fuel, which are projected to bring the size of this subsidy to zero by mid-2024. \n\n# Colombia \n\n## Economic scenario \n\nEconomic activity remains remarkably robust. With the GDP increasing 8.6% in 1Q22, 12.6% in 2Q22 and 7% in 3Q22, 2022 was an impressive year for the Colombian economy, bolstered by robust household consumption and rapid gross fixed capital formation (GFCF). But not all that glitters is gold. Despite private consumption growth (p.a.) remaining robust, performance is contingent upon the dynamics of consumer credit, which is beginning to exhibit signs of deterioration due to contractionary monetary policy. In addition, household consumption has decelerated recently, in seasonal terms, being another symptom of the slowing economy. The fact that Colombia\'s economic cycle has been more robust than expected indicates that today\'s success is accompanied by a diminished outlook for the future. Thus, we have raised our 2022 GDP growth projection to 7.8%. \n\nGrowth of the GDP in 2022 8.6% \n\n1Q22 \n\n# 12.6% \n\n2Q22 \n\n# 7% \n\n3Q22 With a better-than-expected performance, GDP growth in 2022 exacerbated the deficit in current transactions. \n\n65 65 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n# Financial performance Business performance Targets of the 2030 Agenda: 13.1, 13.2 \n\nBased on a solid balance sheet, BTG Pactual delivered consistent growth in 2022, even under adverse market conditions, with solid profitability and strong capitalization. \n\nIn 2022, we achieved another period of record-breaking revenues and net income, despite the macroeconomic cycle being quite challenging. The results are attributed to three primary factors: operational leverage gain, revenue diversification, and synergy across all our business areas. We recorded strong net inflows (NNM) of R$ 254 billion in 2022, leading to a total AuM/WuM of R$ 1.3 trillion. Our funding base has grown significantly over the course of the year, with retail participation reaching 26.3% (30.5%, including Banco Pan), while maintaining astrong and well-capitalized balance sheet. Due to a specific, widely publicized event, we provisioned R$ 1.1 billion in the Corporate & SME Lending area, due to our credit exposure, and R$ 77 million in the Sales & Trading area, due to our exposure to other marketable securities. This specific event also impacted bonus expenses, which were reduced by R$ 153.1 million, and income tax and social contribution expenses, which decreased by R$466.9 million in the last quarter of the year. Thus, the non-recurring provisions negatively impacted BTG Pactual\'s net income by R$ 580 million. In addition to transparency and commitment to our clients, shareholders, and partners in providing information about non-recurring provisions, we have taken swift action to safeguard the interests of all involved and are confident that this isolated incident does not reflect the general state of our business. The 2022 results demonstrate this. We closed out the year with total revenues of R$ 17.2 billion, a 24.1% increase from 2021, making it the best year in our history. Our adjusted net income was also significant: R$ 8.3 billion, up 27.9% from the previous year. Our revenues from Asset Management and Wealth Management recorded strong growth in 2022 of 31.1% and 66%, respectively, year-over-year. The Sales & Trading area recorded record revenues, due to the accelerated increase of our client base, and ended the year with growth of 23.8%. Corporate & SME Lending revenues climbed 5.4% year-on-year—the growth rate would have been 48.7% if non-recurring provisions were excluded. \n\n66 66 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Performance 2019 vs. 2022

We offer a broad range of services in this segment, including subscrip-tion and placement of securities in the capital markets, both debt and equity, and providing financial advi-sory services to businesses, financial institutions, funds, governments, and individuals. Although these services are primarily provided to clients based in the region, we also serve clients from outside Latin America, including entities and individuals looking to take part in mergers, acquisitions, and other tran-sactions involving securities or other Latin American marketable securities, as well as services for foreign clients who want to list their securities on the Brazilian Stock Exchange. \n\n# Performance in 2022 \n\nDespite the challenging macroecono-mic scenario in 2022, the Investment Banking area achieved a strong perfor-mance – the second best annual result in its history. Revenues reached R$ 1.8 billion, 20.1% below the record value of R$ 2.3 billion reached in 2021. The low activity in equity underwriting (ECM) during the year was partially offset by record-breaking revenues in debt underwriting (DCM) and finan-cial advisory (M&A). We have ended another year leading the rankings of M&A and ECM and are consolidating ourselves as one of the main DCM players, as we expand our distribu-tion capabilities. \n\n## Categories of services \n\nCapital Markets \n\nConsultancy for subscription and placement of public and private offerings of stocks and bonds. \n\nM&A and Advisory \n\nEncompasses advisory roles in mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, spin-offs, reorganizations, and other major corporate transactions.

G4-FS8 \n\nWe were active in numerous offerings throughout the year, and it is noteworthy to highlight our role as the lead coordinator in the first issuance of blue debentures in Brazil. Its relevance is also due to the fact that it is the first of its kind in the private sector in Latin America, and also the first in the sanitation sector worldwide. The offer, in the amount of R$ 1.95 billion, was issued by BRK Ambiental, one of the largest private sanitation companies in Brazil, and will benefit more than 1.5 million people living in the city of Maceió and surrounding areas for the next 35 years. For this operation, we were recognized as the Impact Initiative of the Year – Latin America and the Caribbean – by the Impact Awards 2022 of Environmental Finance.

Our primary focus in corporate credit is to meet the needs of large corporations, cre-ating tailored solutions that fit each client\'s business profile and objectives, such as cash flow management and mismatches between assets and liabilities. More recently, we have also started to offer, in Brazil, financing for Small and Medium Enterpri-ses (SMEs). In our financing operations, we act as creditors to a wide range of clients, from me-dium-sized corporations to larger companies with the potential to become market leaders and make public stock offerings in the future. By leveraging the significant synergies be-tween this area and other business units, we aim to bolster our credit platform, both to strengthen our relationship with corporate clients already in our portfolio and to broa-den the bank\'s client base. Thus, we promote cross-selling, primarily in the areas of Invest-ment Banking, Wealth Management, and the Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC) distribution desk. \n\n## Featured areas \n\nHigh Grade Credit Desk \n\nCustomized credit solutions for large corporations. \n\nSpecial Situations \n\nArbitration in loans and acquisition of non-performing loan portfolios. \n\nSME Lending \n\nAnticipation of receivables and credit card receivables operations for small and medium-sized businesses, via 100% digital platform. \n\n76 76 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Digital platform for SMEs \n\nIn order to make managing SMEs easier, we developed an integrated digital financial platform in 2019 to offer suppliers payment in advance. Today, the platform also offers solutions like anticipation of credit card receivables, corporate entity checking accounts, and credit cards. Its intuitive interface has emerged as a great opportunity to increase access to credit, as well as making it easier to use our other products, and automating daily tasks of reconciliation and integration with ERPs, which are designed to support our clients\' daily operations. Other attributes to be highlighted are the agility and security of transactions, which ensure that analyses and credit concessions are made through less bureaucratic processes, helping to identify the best solutions for each client, according to the risk and its demands. This enabled us to bring to the market our knowledge and expertise in credit concessions, combined with the intensive use of technology, which has expanded and continues to expand our footprint, both geographically and in segments that we would not be able to operate organically.

To meet energy demand across the country and to diversify its energy portfolio, other renewable energy systems, such as solar, are being expanded. The agricultural sector accounts for 25% of the Brazilian GDP and is considered an essential sector for BTG Pac-tual. In 2022, we identified the opportunity to provide new lines of agricultural and solar financing, as access to credit for small and medium-sized producers remains highly bu-reaucratic and restricted. Recently, we have entered into partnerships that help us predict future crop performance through satellite data analysis. This technology has enabled us to better scale our service offerings by financing the cost of harvesting. BTG also provides financing solutions for machinery, agri-cultural insurance, storage, and logistics services, acting as the off-taker of the primary commodities produced in Brazil. \n\n## 2022 Highlights \n\nBest bank in the world for SMEs \n\nSME Bank Awards 2023 – Global Finance Magazine \n\n## R$ 22.7 bi \n\nin the credit portfolio \n\n## R$ 512.9 million \n\nin the SME portfolio: comprising different companies, from which at least 51% of these are led by women \n\nLegal entity account evolution \n\nPreviously, operations focused on access to capital, and now, services have been expanded to provide full digital banking solutions.

Given the need to expand the number of credit lines and vo-lume of resources available to meet the in-creasing demand for this technology in the country, we are developing Solar and Agro credit lines with no bureaucracy, so that distributors and rural producers can access the resources immediately and pay back the credit over a longer period of time, for solar energy systems and, after harvest, for rural producers. This is in line with the realities of these sectors and markets. \n\n## Special Situations \n\nIt is the unit of the Corporate & SME Lending area dedicated to credit arbitration in loans and the acquisition and capitalization of non-performing loans. Arbitration can occur in a variety of contexts, which include the turnaround of large companies. These transactions are characterized by higher returns and a greater risk of default than our primary corporate lending business, and their risks are mitigated by comprehensive collateral packages. \n\nIn 2022, we acquired controlling interest in Banco BESA S.A.

Whether due to the sector, resource allocation, or the presence – or likelihood of presence – of significant negative socio-environmental and climate impacts in the operation. The classification of an operation as being of high risk entails, in addition to a more in-depth analysis, monitoring with the client, which can be done by the ESG team itself or by technical consulting specialized in socio-environmental and climate issues. Depending on the severity of the identified risk and/or the counterparty\'s ability to manage these risks, we may also suggest engaging specialized socio-environmental and climate consulting services to develop adiagnosis and action plan with a timeline for implementation. Failure to comply with this plan may result in the early termination of the operation\'s contracts. These A-rated transactions are reported quarterly to the teams directly involved in the Corporate & SME Lending activities, the Risk and ESG Committees, and the bank\'s senior management. \n\n## High Risk Operations \n\nIn 2022, 512 of BTG Pactual\'s loans were analyzed by the ESG area.

In addition, we had an increase in exposure by 2% p. a. in the oil and gas sector. We are aware that this scenario can be explained by significant operations that occurred in 2022 and were only approved after the development of a tailored action plan for reducing emissions and transitioning to a more climate-friendly approach, which included diversifying portfolios and/or investing in research and development.

Companies that operate in the production and/or commercialization of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, coal) and their byproducts accounted for 5.8% of the portfolio. When the counterparty has demonstrated adherence to best practices, we are able to provide certain benefits. Available initiatives include bilateral issuance with a green seal for environmental benefits, a social seal for social benefits, or contracts tied to sustainability goals that, if met by the counterparty, provide a discount on the bank\'s operation fee. G4-FS11 \n\nOperations benefiting from any of these seals can only be completed with a favorable opinion after a prior analysis, for all cases, conducted by a specialized company hired to ensure the effective socio-environmental and/or climate benefits of these practices.

With this, it is integrated into operations with socio-environmental and climate benefits, to use the resources obtained by the bank in its issuance of Green Bonds. In this case, specific indicators by sector and project are analyzed, which ensure the proof of benefits.

We are constantly striving to expand our operations in the region to provide a comprehensive range of products tailored to emerging markets. With this focus, we invested in our digital investment platform, increasing our capacity to provide our products to clients who previously had no access to our investment solutions. \n\n# Asset Management \n\nFixed income and equity - Brazil Global hedge funds Fund services Fixed income and equity - LatAm Alternative Investments \n\nProduct line \n\n# Business segments \n\nManagement services \n\nManagement of our proprietary funds portfolio This includes fixed income and equity, multi-asset, structured and Private Equity funds in Latin America and globally, tailored to meet the needs of our different clients. \n\nFund management \n\nCalculation of the net asset value of onshore and offshore funds, and provision of services such as asset pricing, registration and transfer agency, fee and other expense control, preparation of reports on the fund\'s portfolio composition and for the fund\'s clients, and calculation of applicable taxes. \n\n# Performance in 2022 \n\nOur actively managed funds have seen strong funding, particularly in the Brazil Fixed Income and Alternative Investments strategies, and we continue to grow our market share in the Fund Services business.

Whether it be in providing advice, offering products and services to our clients, or helping them reach their financial goals, we always strive to create value while preserving capital and adhering to the best market practices and sustainable growth. The ESG integration process in Asset Management is guided by a Responsible Investment Policy, which was revised in 2022 and approved by the Board of Directors. This policy sets forth a set of principles that guide the selection and management of fund assets in accordance with BTG Pactual\'s ESG criteria. We understand Responsible Investing to mean, besides acting in accordance with our policy, the application of our ESG Framework in investment decisions. In the decision-making process, the \n\nIn 2022, we enhanced our KPI methodology and adopted two divisions: (i) ESG integration, which corresponds to the funds in which we perform KYC processes, and (ii) ESG Framework, as defined in the Responsible Investment Policy. In 2022, 49.77% of our AuM integrates ESG aspects, and 11.75% integrates our ESG Framework. For comparison, we adjusted the number reported in 2021 and found that 47.50% of our AuM had ESG integration and 11.25% was integrated with the ESG Framework. \n\nG4-FS11 | FN-AC-410a.2 \n\nprinciples of relevance, and proportionality are considered, as well as risks and return, taking into account the particularities of each investment strategy. \n\nRelevance: degree of exposure to environmental, social, and climate risks, as well as factors related to the governance of the economic sector to which the counterparty belongs or the activity it carries out; and \n\nProportionality: compatibility of the analysis with the size and complexity of the investment strategy, the nature of the operation, and the estimated duration of the resources in the fund under management. The ESG analysis starts with an assessment of the sector of activity and the material legal, regulatory, and reputational risks for the sector. This assessment can be done by consulting stakeholders, as well as through independent research, the hiring of specialized consultants, and/or the use of international frameworks such as the IFC Performance Standards. If applicable, the next step is to evaluate the management capability of the investment vehicle/company based on the following criteria: \n\nAbility of the company or its personnel to handle ESG issues. The organization\'s commitment to the ESG agenda. Socio-environmental and governance practices adopted. If the counterparty is in good standing with the government on socio-environmental issues and if it is registered in the Ministry of Economy\'s Register of Employers who have subjected workers to conditions analogous to slavery. \n\nFinally, in collaboration with the business team, we identify the key points of the assessment and propose potential mitigations for any impacts discovered. During the decision-making process, investment committees may be responsible for analyzing assets, economic conditions, fund positions, and defining or adjusting investment strategies. The ESG & Impact Investing team may have a seat with veto power over operations on some of the committees. Reinforcing our broader commitment to sustainability, in the Asset Management activity we are signatories to the following initiatives: \n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI) , where international investors work together to put into practice six principles for responsible investing. \n\nInvestidores pelo Clima , which aims to bring investors together in a collaborative and educational movement to incorporate risks associated with climate change.

In 2022, seizing new market opportunities, we structured an Investment Fund in Agroindustrial Production Chains (Fiagro), confident in the appeal of this fund and the growth of thematic funds for various sectors of the Brazilian agribusiness industry. Through a joint venture between Inverlink Estructuras Inmobiliarias and BTG Pactual, Visum Capital was established, a real estate fund that is one of the five largest in Colombia. The total value of its assets is R$ 1.6 billion, which is approximately equivalent to US$ 307 million 1 , and its equity is R$ 1.2 billion – approximately US$ 238 million 2.Although highly significant, financial data is not the primary attribute of Visum Capital, but its ESG performance. Launched in 2020, the following year it became asignatory to the PRI. In 2022, it was the first fund in Latin America to participate in the Green Pathways for Real Estate Institutional Portfolio (GRIP), an initiative of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which aims to reach Net Zero by the year 2050 and guarantees access to financing lines for 2022/2024 investments. Of its total of 31 assets, four have already achieved certification –two in Edge and two in LEED – and two more are in the process of certification. In 2022, Visum also prioritized the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) among all its integrations with ESG initiatives. Furthermore, asustainability consulting firm was appointed to assess the assets, and an environmental engineer from the fund itself is overseeing this work. This entire process is overseen and supported by the ESG team from the Brazilian headquarters, to ensure full alignment with BTG Pactual\'s strategic guidelines in the management of environmental, social and governance matters. In an operation that has been under design for over a year, Kepler Weber, a Brazilian leader in the production of grain storage systems, BTG Pactual, and BNDES finalized the structuring of an Investment Fund in Agroindustrial Production Chains (Fiagro) in December 2022. Brazil has a grain storage deficit of approximately 30%, and the agribusiness sector has been calling for investments in storage systems for a considerable amount of time. The federal government\'s Warehouse Construction and Expansion Program (PCA) is always insufficient to meet all demands. Therefore, in practice, this type of investment has been supported with the producers\' own resources, to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the capitalization achieved in each harvest. With total capital of R$ 300 million to be paid up over the next two years, the objective of this thematic Fiagro is to provide credit to Kepler Weber\'s clients, focusing on small and medium-sized producers. The fund has a long-term financing mechanism for Kepler Weber\'s equipment and also for the civil works that make up the entirety of the project. The program aims to finance at least 25 farmers. Fiagro Direitos Creditórios will be managed by BTG Pactual Asset Management and Kepler Weber will act as the originator, offering financing terms of up to 10 years with a maximum rate capped at CDI+6.0% for new projects. In addition, BNDES involvement requires more precise reporting on the productivity impacts for small-scale producers. The expectation is to allocate the entire amount by the second quarter of 2024, and to hold a new funding round in 2023 with the potential to reach at least R$ 800 million over the next three years. 1 On December 31, 2022. 2Likewise. \n\nBTG Pactual\'s ESG integration extends to Colombia BTG Pactual supports Kepler Weber with Fiagro to finance grain storage projects \n\nCase Case \n\n90 90 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\nAs a result of our initiave to link global investors to sustainable and impactful investment opportunities, we have been steadily advancing initiatives in asset management. In 2022, our Impact Investment Fund (BTG Pactual Investimentos de Impacto FIP) completed its third investment: the acquisition of a stake in Bioelements, a company specializing in bioplastics that provides asustainable alternative to traditional plastic. In the first quarter of 2022, we launched Venture Debt Fund I, a Chile-based fund focused on financing startups to accelerate their growth and expansion, while also promoting contributions to the UN\'s Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, we structured and distributed two funds dedicated to Sustainable Finance issuances, such as Green, Social, Sustainable, and Sustainability-Linked Bonds, one focused on emerging markets and the other in Brazil, the ESG EM Bond Fund and the Corporate Credit ESG RF IS, respectively. \n\nboostLAB is BTG Pactual\'s startup acceleration program, having been chosen for the fourth consecutive year by Global Finance magazine as one of the 25 best financial innovation centers in the world. In addition, it has been awarded twice as one of the Top 100 Open Corps by 100 Open Startups and took first place in Open Innovation for Latin America in the Corporate Startups Stars award, organized by Mind the Bridge in collaboration with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). Created in 2018 via an equity-free phase, boostLAB enabled us to create perception of value by entrepreneurs, who, based on this promoted acceleration, found themselves connected with business opportunities, investors and content, allowing the accelerated companies to receive more than US$ 630 mm in investments. After 5 years, it has established itself as the premier acceleration program for Scale-up in Latin America, drawing in hundreds of applications annually. Starting in 2023, the chosen startups will receive R$500,000 in exchange for a 3% stake. In the next funding round, there will be the option of an additional contribution of up to R$1 million. \n\n# Impact investment boostLAB \n\nEnvironmental Finance Awards 2022 \n\nWe were awarded the Impact Initiative of the Year – Latin America and the Caribbean for leading the first blue debenture issuance in Brazil.

In this context, BTG Pactual has a strong ESG management structure, guiding its actions to become increasingly relevant in the global decarbonization movement. We strive to adequately measure the emissions of our activities, using precise and reliable methodologies, in order to more conclusively disclose the data afterwards. Taking this effort into account, emissions associated with the purchase and transport of commodities from the G&O trading desk are not accounted for in this inventory. Just as we do with the financed emissions from the Corporate & SME Lending portfolio, we continue to study the topic and test different methodologies until we have confidence in the results. \n\n# Carbon offsetting \n\nPurchase of energy in the free market for the condominium of the BTG SP office (which accounts for 52% of the bank\'s total consumption). Waste management at the main office in São Paulo -Pátio Victor Malzoni. Recycling in the Rio de Janeiro office. Generation of renewable energy in photovoltaic panels in the Medellín (Colombia) office, providing 30% of the energy consumed on site. Practices in BTG Pactual\'s offices to reduce GHG emissions \n\n96 96 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n\nOver the years, BTG Pactual has expanded its actions to offset its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our direct emissions (Scope 1) and part of our indirect emissions (Scope 2) emissions have been offset since 2017 through the purchase of carbon credits. Those in scope 3 began to be offset two years later, including measured indirect emissions and those of our independent autonomous agents. Our team of ESG experts performs thorough due diligence to select certified projects for purchasing carbon credits, so that we can offset our emissions. One of these was the REDD+ Manoa Project, certified by the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) , as well as being certified in Forest Management by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This project aims to preserve 73 thousand hectares of the Amazon Forest located in the state of Rondônia, Brazil, functioning as an important ecological corridor between federal and state conservation units. In this area, there are more than 20 species under special protection. Initiative to increase the use of electric cars by UK employees \n\nIn November 2022, a benefit was launched for employees based in the London office, adopting a policy of incentives for the pur-chase of electric vehicles, instead of combustion-powered cars. In partnership with Octopus Electric Vehicles (OEV), the bank supports the employee in purchasing an electric car. The discount is taken directly from the monthly gross salary, re-sulting in up to 40% savings on taxes owed and on the cost of purchasing an electric vehicle. The initiative encourages employees to reduce their carbon emissions and avoids approximately 1.5 tons of CO 2 annually. \n\n# Evolution in 2022 \n\nIn 2022, our scopes 1 and 2 emissions were down from the previous year. In scope 1, this reduction is due to the lower activation of the bank\'s own generators and those of the condominiums in the offices of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, during the year. In Scope 2, a change was made to the measurement method: the consumption of electricity in units located outside of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro is now estimated based on the consumption and total number of employees in 2022. As the number of employees in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro increased more than the energy consumption in these offices, there was a decrease in energy consumption per employee. Furthermore, the proportion of fossil fuels in the Brazilian electricity matrix had been, on average, three times higher in 2021, resulting in higher emission factors for that year. As for scope 3, in 2022, we enhanced our methodology for estimating emissions from category 7 of scope 3 (employee commuting). As a result, we retroactively recalculated and audited the 2019 and 2020 inventories to incorporate this shift in methodology. Furthermore, with the end of the Covid-19 restrictions and the increase in the number of bank employees, business travel has become more frequent, contributing to the rise in emissions in this category. As an incentive for sustainable practices, BTG Pactual purchased sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with Delta Airlines to offset emissions equivalent to 30 tons of CO 2 from air travel by bank\'s employees. \n\n2022 tCO 2eemissions 397.2 Scope 2 9,727.1 Scope 3 341.2 \n\n> 3% of total emissions 4% of total emissions 93% of total emissions\n\nScope 1 Financed emissions \n\nApplicable to companies providing financial services, Scope 3 Category 15 emissions are those associated with the company\'s investments in the year that have not yet been accounted for in Scopes 1 or 2, as per the GHG Protocol.

In addition to measuring and offsetting our emissions, we support and adopt the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which encourages transparency on climate information, and we have included the SDGs in our materiality analysis and GRI report. In 2020, we established the Impact Investing area, dedicated to advancing sustainable and impact investments and carbon markets. We have also incorporated multiple ESG indexes, indicating that we are taking concerted action on climate-related matters. With the global evolution of the ESG agenda in 2021, we have advanced in integrating these topics into our business model, through the process of creating our materiality and identifying the opportunities involved. Based on our analysis of the main environmental and social issues that pressure various segments of society, and our understanding of the importance of ESG factors for the continuity of our clients\' businesses, we have set three commitments for 2025 related to climate change, sustainable development, and economic inclusion. These commitments are closely intertwined with our core business and are pertinent to the current needs of Latin America. \n\n# Business integration \n\nTargets of the 2030 Agenda: 17.16 GRI 201 3-3 \n\n## Indexes integrated by BTG Pactual BTG Pactual 2025 Commitments  \n\n> B3\'s Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE B3) B3\'s Carbon Efficient Index (ICO 2B3) S&P/B3 Brazil ESG Index FTSE4Good Index Support clients in the transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy Be a reference in the topic of climate change in Latin America Offer credit and foster sustainable practices in the SME segment\n\n99 99 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Climate engagement \n\nBanco BTG Pactual has actively taken part in the transition to a low-carbon economy through both internal and external climate engagement. Understanding our impacts and those of our clients requires analyzing practices, commitments, and scenarios related to greenhouse gas emissions from supply chains, as well as the resilience of counterparts to regulatory, social, and market changes caused by climate change. Internally, loans in GHG-intensive sectors such as energy, steel, oil, and gas are analyzed according to counterparty characteristics, such as emissions, reduction commitments, and climate resilience. Clients are compared to the best practices of the market, and the results are discussed in the credit committees. At least once a year, companies within the group operating in intensive sectors are consulted on their targets, transition plans, and mitigation practices. For example, in 2022, the guarantee operation for the purchase of a fossil thermoelectric plant was only approved after the counterparty assumed concrete commitments to reduce emissions in the plant\'s life cycle, such as its early decommissioning and investment in maintaining the plant\'s efficiency. Another example was the acquisition of a mature oil field, whose buyer agreed to follow an action plan for compliance with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) standards, as will be indicated by a socio-environmental due diligence, performed by a third party of the bank\'s choice. This includes a climate component, such as reducing or eliminating flares and increasing energy efficiency in equipment powered by internal combustion. Clients in intensive sectors with potential for mitigating GHG emissions are advised to follow a personalized action plan for reducing emissions and enhancing climate resilience, including portfolio diversification and/or investments in R&D, a climate transition plan, and engagement with clients and suppliers. \n\nWe analyze GHG emissions associated with the practices of our clients in intensive industries and create action plans to guide those with a potential to reduce emissions. \n\n## Follow-up \n\nBTG Pactual monitors the evolution of the action plan and the emissions of its portfolio. We do not have exclusion policies for climate-related issues, as we believe that a climate strategy focused on engagement rather than exclusion is more effective, providing new opportunities for clients in critical industries. By providing close support to these clients from the moment of their diagnosis, with a technically specialized team, we negotiate favorable contract conditions and accompany them on their decarbonization journey, offering solutions that meet their needs. By doing so, we are enhancing the efficiency of these sectors, aiding in the reduction of their emissions and transitioning to a long-term Net Zero operational standard. \n\nGRI 201-2 3-3 \n\n100 100 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n## Carbon pricing \n\nBTG Pactual closely monitors the decisions of the main recent forums discussing climate change, such as the Paris Agreement and COP21, including the goal of limiting global warming to less than 2°C. With a high-level perspective, we conducted a first internal carbon pricing exercise in 2021, using the results to guide our ESG strategies. In 2022, we broadened the scope to Corporate & SME Lending portfolio clients in GHG-intensive industries, estimating the effect of various carbon pricing scenarios on their revenue. The results enabled us to devise a strategy for incorporating these metrics into our analyses of operations, investments, and educational tools for our clients. The global financial sector is testing various tools for analyzing the risks and impact of climate change in order to reduce climate risk in asset management and credit portfolio in the actions involving the commitments of the decarbonization phase of the economy. In addition to adopting two tools on a national and international scale for small and medium-sized businesses, we have developed an internal automated credit risk system that automatically blocks the operation if the predetermined rules are not met (for more information on this topic, see Risk Management by clicking here). \n\n# Climate risk assessment \n\nTargets of the 2030 Agenda: 13.1; 13.3 GRI 201-2 3-3 \n\n## Brazil \n\nClimate Risk Sensitivity Tool \n\nDeveloped by Febraban, assesses the sensitivity of the banks\' credit portfolio to cli-mate risks. \n\n## Global \n\nScenario Analysis Tool – PACTA \n\nGlobal tool that validates the funds managed by the Asset Management area. \n\nRisk analysis tools Acute physical risks \n\nRelated to extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, frosts, among others. \n\nChronic physical risks \n\nOriginating from changes in climate patterns, such as rising temperatures and alte-rations in precipitation. \n\nClimate transition risks \n\nThreats companies face to their revenue and business model due to the emergence of disruptive technology, changes in climate policies (such as pricing of emissions), shifts in the supply or demand of products and services, loss of market share due to a de-clining public perception, and climate liabilities generated, for example, by difficulties in obtaining licenses. \n\nTypes of climate risks \n\n101 101 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\nTo increase transparency regarding our socio-environmental initiatives, particularly those related to the climate agenda, we respond to initiatives that are in line with global reference frameworks. In these publications, we detail our policies and practices related to the topic. • Principles for responsible banking (PRB/UNEP-FI) Commitment and transparency \n\nTargets of the 2030 Agenda: 16.6 \n\n## Climate stress test \n\nIn 2022, we initiated the climate stress test project to assess the impact on our portfolio of the climate risks, both physical and of the transition to a low-carbon economy. The utilities sector is the most relevant in the bank\'s Corporate & SME Lending portfolio. Therefore, we believe that a more granular approach at the asset level enables us to estimate chronic physical climate risk (associated with long-term climate change) and incorporate the results into credit analysis. We can work with clients to reduce these risks over the medium and long term. For the electricity sector, we partner with PSR energy consulting to develop and implement climate models. These models project future scenarios of physical data, such as reservoir flow and wind speed, which are then applied to our clients\' asset performance models. As such, it is possible to estimate the impacts on production and revenue over a 30-year period and quantify the climate-related impacts and risks. The climate stress test also enables the quantification of the impact of a potential emission tax (in various scenarios) on credit clients in intensive sectors, such as oil and gas, steel, cement, and mining. For these cases, a climate resilience assessment standard was developed. The data generated from the assessment will be integrated into the credit analysis, taking into account the time frame up to 2050 and the selected scenarios. \n\nDecarbonization targets Classification of their transition plans Diversification of investments in low carbon segments Climate litigation actions \n\nClimate resilience assessment items for intensive sectors \n\n> Access our latest reports here\n\n• CDP Report 102 102 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n# Forest assets Targets of the 2030 Agenda: 6.6; 15.1; 15.2; 15.a; 15.b \n\nThe Timberland Investment Group (TIG) is one of the biggest and longest-standing forest investment managers in the world. It is a division of the Asset Management area, with US$ 5.6 billion in assets under management and more than 1.2 million hectares under its administration 1 .Through it, we seek to identify investment opportunities in forest assets to generate climate, social, and financial benefits. TIG takes into account environmental, social, and governance factors before making investment decisions and is dedicated to preserving biodiversity in all regions where it manages properties. Furthermore, it advances this vision through the forestry management production chain, granting preferential positions to companies that demonstrate their dedication to ESG matters. TIG is working to expedite the transition to a regenerative economy, striving to provide natural climate solutions at scale. These solutions are actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural and modified ecosystems in order to mitigate climate change while simultaneously addressing other social issues. The primary goal is to fill the gap between the natural potential of a forestry sector to help combat climate change and what has been accomplished thus far, hastening the transition to a renewable economy of the future through investments that leverage the multiple benefits of climate-positive reforestation. \n\nWhat is the Forest Productivity Cooperative (FPC) \n\nPartnership of the forestry faculty at North Carolina State University and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, in the USA; the Universidad de Concepción, in Chile; and Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, in Brazil, with forestry companies in the Americas. \n\nTIG is a member of the Forest Productivity Cooperative (FPC) \n\nThe FPC conducts research on tree growth and how fo-rests respond to forestry management practices.

Half of the areas will be designated for the protection and restoration of native forests. The other half are being set aside to establish commercial farms for sustainable forestry management and carbon offsetting. The goal is to generate large-scale financial returns while simultaneously creating climate, environmental and social benefits for the regions of implementation. To achieve the anticipated environmental and social impacts, the Reforestation Fund is supported by the expertise of Conservation International (CI), one of the most renowned and respected conservation organizations globally. We believe \n\n## Reforestation Strategy \n\nPremium removals \n\nClear additionality with high social and environ-mental impact and robust project design. \n\n## Initial goals \n\nPlanting of 200 million trees in 140,000 hectares of degraded area.

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the United States development bank, is working on the release of a US$ 50 million debt investment in the reforestation strategy of Timberland Investment Group (TIG). Our strategy involves the mobilization of US$ 1 billion to support the restoration of around 300,000 hectares of degraded land in Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. The DFC\'s investment project in TIG\'s reforestation strategy was one of the US government initiatives announced personally by President Joe Biden at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate leaders\' meeting on April 20, 2023. \n\nImpact at scale \n\nPlanting of 200 million trees on 140 thousand hectares of degraded land. \n\nGeographic advantages \n\nLand availability, high biological growth rates with technologi-cally advanced forest products industry. \n\n105 105 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n# Operational Eco-efficiency Targets of the 2030 Agenda: 6.4; 7.3; 9.4; 12.5 3-3 | GRI 303 3-3 | GRI 306 3-3 \n\nIn addition to integrating ESG into our business strategy and encouraging clients and investors to engage in the pursuit of sustainable develop-ment, we are continuously taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of our offices. This is accomplished through the permanent monitoring of eco-efficiency indicators, related to water and energy consumption and waste management, in the buildings where the bank\'s administrative ac-tivities take place. The building where our main office is located, in São Paulo (SP), and where most of our employees are based, received the LEED Platinum EB O&M V4 certification in 2019. This certification proves the efforts made with a focus on sustainability and the improvements made in favor of the surroun-ding environment. This certification version, geared towards operation and maintenance, attests to the building\'s eco-efficiency advantages and its com-mitment to the best environmental practices. In 2021, the certification was renewed. \n\n# Water \n\nTo achieve water autonomy, the administration of the condominium where our main office is located in São Paulo has drilled an artesian well that provides 7.5m³/h of water, in addition to capturing rainwater and maintaining a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which on average produces 2,000 m³ of treated water per month. The individual water consumption readings for each unit are also sent to the units on a monthly basis. This information is compiled by the ESG area into asustainability indicator system. All these initiatives enabled a significant reduction in the consumption of water supplied by the utility. GRI 303-2 \n\nIn the condominium where our headquarters is located in Rio de Janeiro, there is a great effort to engage the condominium owners in order to make them more efficient in their water consumption. In addition, measures were implemented in the common areas of the condominium to reduce the flow of water in the faucets and toilets. Just like in São Paulo, there are individual water meters in the building, enabling the ESG area to monitor and control monthly consumption indicators. \n\n2022 \n\n9.71 \n\nGRI 303-5 | WATER CONSUMPTION (IN MEGALITERS) 2021 \n\n5.36 \n\n1.

In cases where this is not feasible, we value the use of sustainably sourced materials for supply (such as FSC-certified paper), recycling, and proper disposal of waste. The recyclable waste is sent to waste pickers\' cooperatives, while the organic waste goes to composting and a biodigester. Only the waste or materials not sorted by the condominium owners are sent to landfills. GRI 306-1 | GRI 306-2 \n\nIn 2022, only 23% of our waste was sent to landfills, the lowest percentage in recent years, due to the rise in external composting and the enhancement of separation and sorting of waste. We saw a rise in waste production in 2022 with the resumption of on-site activities in offices due to the lifting of restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the increased number of employees. On the other hand, by implementing a project to control printing 2 in order to reduce the risk of information leakage caused by leaving documents in printers, we achieved a 27% reduction in our total printing volume, which amounts to over 297 thousand sheets of paper. \n\n# Energy \n\nAt our main office in São Paulo, there is a central air conditioning system equipped with chillers, compressors with magnetic bearings, which provide great energy efficiency due to their lack of friction. All lighting is done with led lamps, of low energy consumption The condominium also has elevators equipped with a system that stores the energy generated through braking and automatically shuts off when not in use, to reduce consumption. In addition, it has a thermoelectric plant (TPP), with 100% autonomy, that is used in the event of a power outage from the utility. In addition, we have workstations in the living space equipped with solar energy panels. \n\n2021 \n\n915.67 105.12 60,642.21 \n\n61,663.00 \n\n2022 \n\n172.61 18.70 34,476.16 \n\n34,667.46 \n\nNon-renewable fuels (diesel) Renewable fuels Purchased electricity \n\nTotal \n\n2020 \n\n60.79 8.29 36,039.86 \n\n36,108.94 \n\nGRI 302-1 | ENERGY CONSUMPTION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION (GJ) 1.

The initiatives are based on the Central Bank\'s guidelines and the efforts coordinated by Febraban\'s Financial Citizenship Working Group. In 2022, as requested by the Central Bank, a mapping was conducted and 49 initia-tives undertaken by BTG Pactual were identi-fied, targeting both novice and advanced users and open to all of the bank\'s stakeholders. The actions are organized into three axes, according to the main objective, the type of intervention and the priority target au-dience. The contents are as follows: organi-zing and planning a budget, building savings, and gaining an understanding of and using financial products and services responsibly, including credit and investments. Content curation brings together financial educators, invited renowned experts, and BTG Pactual employees. These names include Gustavo Cerbasi, André Bona and Mirna Borges. The information covers everything from founda-tional concepts of the financial market to more intricate analyses, which focus on the impacts of the economic and political envi-ronment.

It is the first project-based technology college located in Brazil, in the city of São Paulo. The mission of the institution is to train leaders in technology, and to do so, an innovative curriculum was designed with skills that extend beyond computing, incorporating disciplines such as entrepreneurship, market economics, rule of law, and sustainability into the curriculum. The goal is for students to learn how to make a real impact on society, seeking solutions to today\'s challenges in a practical way. The courses will have a duration of four years. In each module, students develop a project to address the needs of a market partner, such as private companies, startups, or non-profit organizations. In addition to providing 50 scholarships to the first class and offering institutional support to Inteli, BTG Pactual, in partnership with its Social Responsibility area, organizes mentoring sessions between BTG employees and scholarship recipients. \n\n# INTELI - Education to cause real impact on society \n\n# 200+ 120+ 100+ 60+ \n\nenrolled students students with scholarships and aid prototypes of projects delivered to society, with open source code, available on the Inteli website Brazilian municipalities contributed young talents to the classes, which started in February/2022 \n\n# 40+ 80+ 4\n\nteaching staff employees on-site undergraduate courses Computer Engineering \n\n## The Institution \n\n5% 1% 23% 76% \n\nNeutral Women Men \n\nGender \n\n25+ years old 20 to 25 years old 16 to 19 years old \n\nAge \n\nOther Black White \n\nEthnicity 15% 78% 28% 70% 2% Profile \n\nSoftware Engineering Computer Science Information Systems \n\n113 113 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 People Management ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n\n114 Human capital \n\n100% of the workforce in Brazil is covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Its purpose is to provide employees with a practical and current overview of how the financial market works, as well as to spread our culture and values and foster collaboration between professionals from different areas. In 2022, 596 employees completed the course – since the beginning of the program in 2014, there have been 1,459 participants. \n\nIT Sessions \n\nSpecialized program for technology employees, 100% taught by bank staff. It consists of 16 modules and is designed to enhance and expand knowledge in a variety of technology topics. Since its inception in 2019, more than 400 students have graduated. \n\nLeadership Academy \n\nProgram focused on our managers. In 2022, it underwent a significant change, due to the rapid growth of the bank and the distinct requirements of each business. A monthly onboarding was implemented for all new leaders in order to ensure their alignment with BTG Pactual\'s leadership principles. In parallel, training was conducted across multiple areas, tailored to their needs and challenges. For Technology leadership, for example, one of the topics discussed was how to manage a hybrid team. \n\nHours of training \n\nMen Women \n\nTotal 2022 2021  \n\n> Notes: The numbers include both permanent and full-time employees, comprising statutory directors and permanent employees under a CLT contract.

All employees, including the highest governance body and senior exe -\n\ncu tives, participate in this process annually. GRI 404-3 | GRI 2-19 \n\nIt is divided into three phases: goal setting, through a proprietary evaluation tool (system) mid-year review of goals and feedback between employees and their managers; and final performance evaluation, which takes into account a set of evaluations (self-evaluation, 360-degree, leadership, and open evaluations). To ensure the accuracy of the evaluation, a calibration meeting is held, with the direct participation of managers and partners, allowing for an open discussion about the employee\'s actual contribution. GRI 404-3 | GRI 2-19 | GRI 2-20 In 2022, we implemented a limit on the number of indications per concept in open evaluations to enhance their effectiveness. \n\nAll teams receive internal policies and guidelines related to economic, environmental, and social aspects, such as the Code of Conduct, Diversity and InclusionPolicy,Social,Environmental,and Climate Responsibility Policy, and more. The performance evaluation includes questions related to adhering to these guidelines. In addition, the company\'s global goals are defined annually, which include socio-environmental, economic-financial, and operational issues. These goals are disseminated to all teams so that individual goals, also linked to our remuneration policy, can be set in order for each person\'s performance to contribute to the attainment of the overall goal.

BTG Pactual ties the distribution of its variable annual remune-ration to the existence of profits. Employees aligned with BTG\'s values and principles and that deliver superior and consistent results have the opportu-nity to receive total remuneration that is higher than the market average and to become partners. The value of variable remuneration is determined qualitatively, based on the performance of the company, team, and individual employees. The fixed salary re-flects their scope of work and position at the bank, as well as their abilities, skills, duties, and deliverables. The monitoring of remuneration in relation to market re-ferences is conducted through salary surveys and does not take into account the opinion of consultants or the votes of stakeholders on remuneration policies and proposals. \n\nThe value of variable remuneration is determined qualitatively, based on the performance of the company, team, and individual employees. \n\n129 129 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 The administrators\' remunera-tion is also established based on market research and is fully tied to the alignment of the interests of the administrators themsel-ves with those of BTG Pactual. The fixed remuneration, which is paid out through pro-labore on a monthly basis, is determined in a general shareholders\' meeting and its primary goal is to ensure high levels of attraction and re-tention of the professionals, es-pecially when compared to the market as a whole. With respect to the practice of termination, indemnities, and Prior Notice period for mem-bers of governance bodies and senior executives, we follow the process in accordance with the requirements of the Brazilian Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT) and labor rights/duties, as well as adhering to the condi-tions agreed upon in the Collec-tive Labor Agreement (CCT) with the category\'s trade union. BTG Pactual does not have clawback practices for its employees. However, the Partnership pos-sesses certain attributes that have a practical effect similar to that of a clawback: (I) the exit – or reduction in shareholding – of a particular individual from the Partnership, through the re-purchase of their shareholding in BTGP Holding, associated with the loss of a future opportunity for appreciation of said assets; and (II) the loss of capital gains from unvested shares, conside-ring that any purchase of sha-res by the partner is subject to vesting rules of three years.

The approach of the end of the interest rate growth cycle coincides with a scenario of waning global economic momentum, which is no different for the Brazilian case. Discussions about structural challenges, such as tax reorganization to increase the efficiency of the business environment, and the stabilization of the public debt trajectory, have arisen in response to the fiscal expansion conducted to mitigate the fluctuations in consumption caused by the pandemic-induced drop in social mobility. Given this context, the volume of new issuances in the capital markets will remain subdued, in line with what has been observed between 2021 and 2022, but with potential for positive changes. Corporate & SME Lending revenues are expected to grow, in line with our consistent dynamic credit risk management – which takes into account the macroeconomic environment and the unique characteristics of each company. The Wealth Management, Asset Management, and Sales &Trading businesses are also expected to continue growing as we reap the rewards of investments made in recent years and an increase in market share in new client and product segments. We have seen strong revenue growth for the group as a whole in this year of a challenging global and domestic macroeconomic context, largely supported by our diversified range of business lines and increased operational leverage. \n\n# Economic challenges and trends \n\n134 134 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Environmental and climate perspective Constant digital evolution \n\nDigital evolution is a crucial factor in driving our growth.

Therefore, we heavily invest in digitalizing our platforms, which, when combined with acomprehensive range of products and services, is essential for increasing market penetration. Thus, our strategy for the coming years is to solidify the structures established in recent years and continue to develop \n\nTargets of the 2030 Agenda: 9.4 \n\nIn 2022, we saw a scenario of constant discussions about the role of organizations and the financial market regarding climate engagement and ensuring a future of net-zero emissions, as well as challenges related to the appreciation of biodiversity. The appreciation of forests and their role in carbon sequestration, as well as discussions about the future of the carbon market, particularly in regards to procedures related to trading rules, present both challenges and opportunities for Brazil and BTG Pactual. New regulations and the immense potential for renewable energies, from forests, and biodiversity are driving the progress of the agenda in Brazil. The expansion of renewable energy sources and distributed generation, such as solar photovoltaic systems, presents promising opportunities for BTG Pactual. Through a consistent socio-environmental risk analysis, the company is seeks to promote climate engagement and expand efforts to promote sustainable practices. innovative solutions such as the cryptocurrency product portfolio, tokenization, and the international account, among others. With this, we will strive for further efficiency gains, while preserving our performance and leveraging our operations even further. Considering the security challenges and the ever-increasing digital transformation in the bank, we are focused on strengthening identity management controls and our backups, as well as discovering, mapping and masking data in data lakes. We will also take an intense approach to ensuring reliable security for applications exposed to the internet, increasing our security testing to analyze our defenses. \n\n135 135 \n\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 Help clients transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy \n\nMacroeconomic conditions and capital markets environment.

We are working to fulfill this commit-ment and, for tracking purposes, we funded approximately R$ 12 billion in 2022 for the solar, hydro, and wind generation segments of the Corporate & SME Lending portfolio. Thus, about 24.8 thousand tons of CO 2 have alrea-dy been avoided. In 2022, we estimated that 29.4% of the total clients in the Oil and Gas sector, which comprise the Corporate & SME Lending portfolio, have conducted a carbon inventory and 23.5% have set emission reduction goals, as well as Net Zero commitments. Regarding the sector\'s exposure, that is, the percentage of the volume financed in the period, 54.03% of the total value corresponds to clients who have GHG inventories and 49.5% corresponds to clients who have emission reduction targets and net zero commitments in place. Also in 2022, we engaged with two of our clients through an operation to acquire a refinery and a mature on-shore field. The request is that they adhere to the IFC standards, as well as having advised them on the opportunity to reduce carbon emissions, and requested the creation of a sustainability report and a GHG inventory.

Scope 1 emissions in 2022 were higher than the previous year, primarily due to increased generator usage and fluid exchanges in air conditioners and fire extinguishers. Scope 2 emissions were substantially lower in 2022. In the year, electricity consumption in offices outside of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro was estimated based on the consumption of these offices and the number of employees. The consump-tion per employee was diluted from 2021 to 2022 as the num-ber of employees in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro increased more than the energy consumption in these offices. Thus, the lowest value per employee was used to estimate consumption in the other units, which, despite having more employees than in 2021, still saw a decrease in total consumption. Furthermore, the average emission factor of the Brazilian matrix decreased from 2021 to 2022, also reducing the emissions estimated for 2022. 13 7; 8; 9 \n\n305-2 \n\nReduction of GHG emissions Not applicable.

São Paulo - SP \n\nIntroduction \n\nWe have been engaged by Banco BTG Pactual S.A. ("Company" or "BTG Pactual") to present our limited letter of assurance on the non-financial information contained in Banco BTG Pactual S.A.\'s 2022 Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our limited assurance does not cover information from prior periods or any other information disclosed alongside the 2022 Annual Report, including any embedded images, audio files, or videos. \n\nResponsibilities of BTG Pactual\'s management \n\nThe management of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. is responsible for: selecting or establishing appropriate criteria for the preparation and presentation of the information included in the 2022 Annual Report; preparing the information according to the criteria and guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-Standards), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) – subsectors Asset Management & Custody Activities, Commercial Banks, Consumer Finance, Investment Banking & Brokerage, and the preparation basis cre-ated by the Company; and designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control over the information re-levant to the preparation of the information contained in the 2022 Annual Report, so that it is presented free of material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. \n\nResponsibility of the independent auditors \n\nOur responsibility is to provide a conclusion on the non-financial information in-cluded in the 2022 Annual Report based on the limited assurance engagements conducted in accordance with Technical Notice CTO 01 – Issuance of Letter of Assurance Related to Sustainability and Social Responsibility, issued by the Brazilian Federal Accounting Council (CFC), in accordance with NBC TO 3000 – Assurance Engagements Other than Audit and Review, also issued by the CFC, which is equi-valent to the international standard ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information, issued by the IAASB – Interna-tional Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. These standards require the auditor to adhere to ethical requirements, maintain independence, and fulfill other related responsibilities, including the application of the Brazilian Quality Control Standard (NBC PA 01). This requires the maintenance of a comprehensive quality control sys-tem, which includes documented policies and procedures for meeting ethical requi-rements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. \n\n156 156 \n\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\nAdditionally, these standards require that the engagements be planned and executed with the goal of providing limited assurance that the non-financial information included in the 2022 Annual Report is free from material misstatements. A limited assurance engagement conducted in accordance with NBC TO 3000 (ISAE 3000) primarily consists of inquiries to BTG Pactual\'s management and other employees involved in the preparation of the information, as well as the application of analytical procedures to obtain evidence that enables us to draw a limited assurance conclusion about the information taken as a whole. A limited assurance engagement also requires the performance of additional procedures when the independent auditor becomes aware of matters that lead them to believe that the information disclosed in the Annual Report, taken as a whole, may present material misstatements. The selected procedures were based on our understanding of the aspects related to the compilation, materiality, and presentation of the information contained in the 2022 Annual Report, other circumstances of the engagement, and our consideration of activities and processes associated with the material information disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report, where relevant misstatements could exist. The procedures included: (a) the planning of the work, taking into account its importance, the amount of quantitative and qualitative data, and the operational systems and internal controls that served as the foundation for the information included in the 2022 Annual Report; (b) gaining an understanding of the calculation methodology and procedures for compiling indicators through inquiries with the managers responsible for preparing the information; (c) the application of analytical procedures on the quantitative information and inquiries about qualitative information and its correlation with the indicators disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report; and (d) for cases where non-financial data are related to financial indicators, the comparison of those indicators with the audited financial statements; (e) the limited assurance engagements also included the analysis of adherence to the guidelines and criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-Standards), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the provisions outlined in the preparation basis created by the Company. We are confident that the evidence gathered in our work is adequate and suitable to substantiate our conclusion in its limited form. \n\nScope and limitations \n\nThe procedures conducted in a limited assurance engagement vary in terms of nature and timing, and are less extensive than those conducted in a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the security level achieved in a limited assurance engagement is significantly lower than what would have been achieved if a reasonable assurance engagement had been conducted. Had we conducted a reasonable assurance engagement, we could have identified other issues and potential misstatements that may exist in the information included in the 2022 Annual Report. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on this information. \n\n> 157 157\n> ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\nNon-financial data is subject to more inherent limitations than financial data due to the variety of methods used to determine, calculate, or estimate the data. Qualitative assessments of materiality, relevance, and accuracy of data are subject to individual assumptions and assessments. Additionally, we do not carry out any work on data reported for past periods, nor in relation to future projections and goals. Similarly, we did not include the validation of avoided emissions calculations in our assurance scope. The contents covered by this assurance are outlined in the preparation basis for the 2022 Annual Report. The preparation and presentation of non-financial information and indicators followed the definitions of the preparation basis created by the Company and the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-Standards) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Therefore, the information presented in the 2022 Annual Report does not aim to ensure compliance with social, economic, environmental, or engineering laws and regulations. These standards, however, require the presentation and disclosure of any violations of such regulations when significant penalties or fines are imposed. Our assurance report should be read and understood within the context of the criteria selected and previously mentioned in this paragraph. \n\nConclusion \n\nBased on the procedures conducted, described in this report, and evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that the non-financial information contained in the 2022 Annual Report of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. has not been compiled, in all relevant material aspects, in accordance with the criteria and guidelines established by the preparation basis and the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-Standards) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). \n\nOther matters \n\nThe limited assurance of non-financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021 was conducted under the responsibility of other independent auditors, who issued a limited letter of assurance without reservations, dated April 4, 2022.
