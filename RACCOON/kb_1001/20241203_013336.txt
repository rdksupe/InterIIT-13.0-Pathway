Its stockpiles of crucial armaments are depleting at a record pace as the war in Ukraine drags on, and its poorly armed allies are even worse off.\xa0 Intelligence officers in Germany said that the country has only two days’ worth of ammunition in case of a military threat. \xa0Companies mentioned in this release include:\xa0 **SQM** (NYSE: SQM), **Centrus Energy Corp.** (NYSE:LEU), **Barrick Gold Corporation** (NYSE:GOLD), **Newmont Corporation** (NYSE:NEM), **Arch Resources, Inc.** (NYSE:ARCH).\n\nIn March 2024, the European Union allocated 500,000,000 Euros under the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP) to boost output capacity to 2 million shells annually by the end of 2025. But the Western militaries have a major problem.\n\nThis push for new military hardware **requires a crucial critical metal called Antimony of which the U.S. produces exactly nothing.** And it gets worse… This summer, China curbed exports of **Antimony**, sending prices soaring by 200% in the course of a few months. But even in this precarious situation, there are a handful of companies from Australia and Canada that are racing to bring online a new stream of antimony supply.\n\nOne of them, a Canadian exploration company called **Military Metals** **(**[**MILI**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILI.CN/)**.CN****;** [**MILIF**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILIF/)**.QB****)**, spotted this disturbing trend early and started scooping up antimony assets in North America and [Europe](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/military-metals-completes-acquisition-brownfield-043200711.html), eyeing a quickly emerging opportunity to provide the Western world with the ability to defend itself against its enemies without Chinese metals.\n\n**New Sources of Antimony, from Slovakia to Nova Scotia**\n\nCritical minerals won the war for the Allies in WWII, precisely because the Allied powers controlled most of the world’s minerals at that point in history, according to the [Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/02/the-us-military-and-nato-face-serious-risks-of-mineral-shortages?lang=en).\n\nToday, the tables have turned and China controls the lion’s share of the world’s most critical minerals, including antimony–a key component of national defense.\n\nBut Military Metals is fighting back, changing the trend with its [newly acquired Antimony assets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/military-metals-adds-key-ground-123000669.html) in Nevada and Nova Scotia, one of the few known sources of antimony in North America.\n\nThe company also recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia with a historical resource. In the heart of Central Europe, it’s a promising Soviet-era resource with an initial discovery from the 1950s and prior development in the ’80s and ’90s. It’s already seen two phases of exploration, including drilling and adit excavation.\n\nThe Slovakian\xa0Trojarova asset is one of the European Union’s largest Antimony deposits and with a historical resource of over 60,998 tons of Antimony has a in-situ value of $2 billion at today’s spot prices and could give Slovakia a chance to become a critical metals hub for Western defense industries.\n\nCompared to its closet peer, **Military Metals** **([MILI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILI.CN/).CN; [MILIF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILIF/).QB)**\xa0appears to be significantly undervalued. Fellow antimony miner Perpetua Resources\xa0has only a slightly larger antimony resource of 90,000 tons but has seen its value soar to around $700 million. Perpetua saw a huge rise from $3 a share to $14 a share in the last 6 months.\n\nMeanwhile, Military Metals is valued at only $25 million right now; yet its historical resource of 60,998 tons has an in-situ value of over $2 billion of antimony in the ground.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, in Canada, Military Metals is sitting on a recently acquired historical antimony/gold play that ended up being a major boom to the Allies in WWI, and reigns supreme as one of Canada’s biggest past producing Antimony mine in the early 1900’s. And on October 24th, 2024, the company pounced on another opportunity to further consolidate this territory by signing an LOI to acquire more claims flanking West Gore.\n\nIt’s an impressive historical resource, with historical drilling results demonstrating over 7 meters of 10.6 gpt gold and 3.4% antimony.\n\nThe move to consolidate territory surrounding West Gore—one of the biggest heroes of WWI—is a strategic move that could tie the junior miner directly to North American defense at a time when prices are skyrocketing.\n\n**Everyone’s on War Footing, and Antimony is the Driver**\n\nWhen China started tightening the noose first on critical battery metal graphite, then on rare earth elements Germanium and Gallium, and finally on Antimony, Military Metals Corp. banded together to make the metals that China refuses to sell their primary business. This smart, fast-moving investment strategy could, according to Forbes, be the “latest to generate short-term profits of more than 100% on money invested”.\n\n**Military Metals**\xa0**([MILI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILI.CN/).CN; [MILIF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MILIF/).QB)**\xa0CEO Scott Eldridge sees a major antimony supply crunch coming. And antimony prices this year, along with new Chinese restrictions add extra support to that prediction with prices doubling since earlier this year from [$12,000 per ton to $38,000](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/09/09/double-your-money-buying-what-china-refuses-to-sell/).\xa0 That’s why it’s been acquiring past-producing antimony mines on two continents at breakneck speed.\n\nThey’re eyeing a confluence of events, one of which is a major U.S. and European Army push to boost production of ammunition that relies on antimony.\n\nArtillery shells are the kings of battle, and the king of kings is the 155-millimeter artillery shell. Now, the U.S. Army has set in motion a major push to ramp up production, gearing up for the opening of a new manufacturing facility in Mesquite, Texas. A second facility in Canada has been contracted to produce shells for the U.S. Overall, the U.S. Army is hoping to ramp up production from the current ~40,000 artillery shells per month, to [100,000 by the New Year](https://www.army.mil/article/279541/us_army_awards_key_contracts_to_further_enhance_155mm_artillery_production_capacity_and_army_modernization_priorities#:~:text=This%20specially%20engineered%20alloy%2C%20used,month%20by%20fiscal%20year%202026.).\n\nThat means they will need to secure a lot more antimony supply, at the same time that China is putting the squeeze on the critical mineral.\n\n**Other miners to watch in December are:**\n\n**SQM (NYSE: SQM)** is a Chilean chemical company and a leading global producer of lithium, a critical component in batteries used in a wide range of applications, including electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and increasingly, military technology.
