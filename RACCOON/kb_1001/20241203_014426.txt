The reconciliation of GII to revenue is set out in note 3(b) \n\nto the consolidated financial statements. \n\n2 ‘Revenue’ is reported in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under this standard, \n\nthe Group is required to exercise judgement to determine whether the Group is acting as principal or agent in \n\nperforming its contractual obligations. Revenue in respect of contracts for which the Group is determined to be \n\nacting as an agent is recognised on a ‘net’ basis, that is, the gross profit achieved on the contract and not the \n\ngross income billed to the customer. \n\n3 ‘Adjusted operating profit’ is a non-IFRS alternative performance measure that excludes from operating profit the \n\neffects of significant items of expenditure that are non-recurring events or do not reflect our underlying operations. \n\nAmortisation of acquired intangible assets and share-based payment charges are excluded.

While these circumstances \n\nbrought considerable challenges, they have \n\nalso been an opportunity to strengthen our \n\nBoard and our governance processes, which \n\nwill remain an area of the upmost importance \n\nfor the Board over the coming year. \n\n>> You will find detailed disclosure on \n\nthis and other related Board changes \n\nin my introduction to corporate \n\ngovernance on pages 68 to 71. \n\nOur thanks to the team \n\nWe achieved our aim of double-digit growth across our \n\nmain metrics, gaining market share and demonstrating \n\nthe resilience of our business model, despite the \n\nuncertainty in the business world, with concerns \n\nabout high interest rates and global conflict stalling \n\ninvestment in many sectors. But there’s another key \n\nfactor that allowed us to achieve these financial \n\nresults, and our impressive customer net promoter \n\nscores and vendor accreditations and awards. That \n\nfactor is our people, whose commitment, hard work, \n\npassion and contribution to good causes are such \n\nimportant parts of our culture. I know I speak for my \n\nfellow directors in saying how very proud and grateful \n\nwe are for what they accomplished during the year. \n\nNew Board members to support our growth \n\nWe welcomed two new directors to Board in the year. \n\nThe promotion of Sam Mudd to the Board in July 2023 \n\nmade her subsequent move into the role of CEO a \n\nnatural evolution for BTG. Sam has an impressive \n\ntrack record. As Managing Director (MD) of Phoenix \n\nshe led the tremendous growth of that business, and \n\nis a role model for women across BTG. On the Board, \n\nshe has proved herself to be an inspiring fellow director. \n\n4 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nOUR BUSINESS Diversity on the Board \n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we are \n\naligned to the FCA Listing Rules, with 60% \n\nwomen on the Board and at least one director \n\nfrom a minority ethnic background. We also \n\nhave women in the roles of CEO and senior \n\nindependent director. \n\nShareholder dividends \n\nBTG’s dividend policy is to distribute 40% \n\nof post-tax pre-exceptional earnings to \n\nshareholders. The Board is pleased to propose \n\na gross final dividend of 6.0 pence per share. \n\nThe proposed dividend is £14.4 million. Given \n\nthe company’s continued strong performance \n\nand cash generation, we are also proposing a \n\ncash return to shareholders with a special \n\ndividend of 8.7 pence per share, equating to \n\n£20.9 million. If approved by shareholders, the \n\nfinal and special dividend will be paid on \n\n2 August 2024. \n\nAlison Vincent stepped down as a non-executive \n\ndirector at the end of her three-year term this year, \n\nso we were delighted to welcome Shruthi Chindalur as \n\na non-executive director at the start of February 2024. \n\nShruthi brings a wealth of commercial and operational \n\nexperience in the technology sector to the role. She \n\nalso takes on the role of designated non-executive \n\ndirector for employee engagement. We also announced \n\nthe resignation with immediate effect of Mike Phillips \n\nas a non-executive director towards the end of March. \n\nOn 1 June 2024, we will also welcome Ross Paterson \n\nand Anna Vikström Persson as independent \n\nnon-executive directors, adding even more to the skills \n\nand experience of the Board. Ross will become Chair of \n\nthe Audit Committee, while Anna will become Chair of the \n\nnewly constituted ESG Committee. You can find details \n\nabout Ross and Anna’s expertise at bytesplc.com .\n\nEngaging and investing in \n\npeople for the long term \n\nEngaging with our stakeholders is an important cultural \n\nattribute of our company, and an example of how we \n\ntake a long-term perspective. We listen closely to our \n\ncustomers and our employees, and I’m pleased that the \n\nrespective net promoter scores of 82 and 71 remain \n\nhigh. We held a Board meeting in our City of London \n\noffice this year, for example, and so had an opportunity \n\nto talk to our employees there, which was greatly \n\ninsightful. Our most senior executives also spend a lot \n\nof time talking to investors. This all gives us confidence \n\nas we continue to invest in our systems, in developing \n\nnew services and, especially, in our people. \n\nTo support our future growth, we’ve expanded our \n\nheadcount by 13.7% this year. It is also important to \n\nmake sure we increase the management capabilities as \n\nour workforce grows. Besides ongoing training and \n\npromotion, we have been assessing leadership skills \n\nthis year to identify gaps, so we can implement the \n\nnecessary development and coaching programmes. At \n\nthe same time, Sam, in her previous role as MD Phoenix, \n\nset up a female leadership acceleration programme, \n\nwhich the Phoenix leadership team is continuing. \n\nMonitoring the opportunities \n\nand risks from AI products \n\nTurning to Board activity, we’ve been focused on monitoring \n\nthe vast potential of the emerging technologies around \n\nartificial intelligence (AI), both for our business internally \n\nand externally as we support our customers. This year \n\nwe’ve been increasing the use of AI-enabled tools in \n\nour operations, to see how they can help us be more \n\nproductive. The feedback we’ve had from people is \n\npromising. Our customers have also shown lots of interest \n\nin AI-supported products, especially Microsoft 365 Copilot. \n\nFor us, the emerging technology presents an opportunity \n\n– to help customers prepare for AI. We are positioned not \n\njust to provide licences to customers, but also to help \n\nthem consider the potential of the technology and to put \n\nthe requisite security and data management practices in \n\nplace before deploying it. \n\nOur commitment to sustainability \n\nIt takes more than great products and services to make a \n\ngreat company – you need a commitment to sustainability, \n\nwhich means looking after people, governance and, of \n\ncourse, the planet, given the considerable challenges \n\nof climate change. This is a focus area for the Board and, \n\nas noted earlier, we are setting up a Board-level ESG \n\nCommittee, with effect from 1 June 2024. During the \n\nyear, our Group sustainability manager helped guide our \n\njourney to net zero, and ensure a coordinated approach \n\nbetween our two businesses. We also submitted our \n\ncarbon reduction targets to the Science Based Targets \n\ninitiative and expanded our efforts to calculate all our \n\nScope 3 emissions for the first time, both of which are \n\nimportant milestones. \n\nA confident outlook \n\nLooking ahead, we are confident about our prospects, \n\nand excited by the refreshed skills and experience on the \n\nexecutive team and the Board. We see encouraging \n\ngrowth opportunities in cloud migration and the hybrid \n\ncloud environment, in our security solutions business \n\nand in AI-enabled tools. Strong foundations, an excellent \n\nmanagement team and a broad range of talent across \n\nthe business mean the Board is looking forward to \n\nsupporting and challenging the executive to achieve \n\nanother year of success. \n\nPatrick De Smedt \n\nChair \n\n22 May 2024 \n\n> Annual Report and Accounts 2023/24\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n> 5\n\n# CEO’s review \n\n# This was a year in which we showed our resilience as a company. \n\n# In a time of geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, and Board \n\n# and leadership changes, our business proved strong, dependable \n\n# and agile, allowing us to extend our long run of double-digit growth. \n\nBy investing in our great people, our culture and \n\nthe technical capability to deliver the solutions \n\nthat our customers need, we are well placed \n\nfor our growth to continue. \n\nI’m very excited to be part of that growth, having been \n\nappointed as BTG’s new CEO. What has become even \n\nclearer in the past few months is the strength of our \n\nrelationships with customers and the depth of our \n\nvendor partnerships. All this is underpinned by the \n\nquality of our people, who I truly believe are some of \n\nthe best in the industry. It’s an honour to lead them \n\nand the wider company in its next chapter. \n\nRobust demand drives strong financial \n\nyear performance \n\nBTG’s performance this year was strong and in \n\nline with expectations, in keeping with our track \n\nrecord since listing in 2020. Though the broader \n\nbusiness environment was at times challenging, \n\nthe demand for the wide-ranging suite of products \n\nand services we provide, especially cloud services \n\nand cybersecurity, remained robust in both the \n\ncorporate and public sectors. We saw double-digit \n\ngrowth in both operations of Bytes and Phoenix. \n\nGross invoiced income (GII) rose by 26.7% to \n\n£1.8 billion, and profit before tax increased by 22.2% \n\nto £61.6 million, as we continued to increase the share \n\nof our customers’ business. These results are testament \n\nto the commitment of our people – their ongoing \n\nwillingness to go above and beyond for our customers \n\nis a constant inspiration. I would like to take this \n\nopportunity to thank them for all their hard work. \n\nDoing more for our customers \n\nTo maintain our edge in a competitive market, we \n\naim to provide the highest level of service to our \n\ncustomers, offering the right, cost-effective advice \n\nfor their needs and expert guidance when it comes \n\nto new technologies. This commitment to quality and \n\nour ability to get things done is crucial if we are to \n\nachieve our ultimate strategic goal each year, which \n\nis to do more business with our existing customers \n\nand to win new ones. \n\nSam Mudd \n\nCEO \n\n6 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nOUR BUSINESS We increased our gross profit (GP) from existing \n\ncustomers by 109%, and added £5.1 million of GP \n\nfrom new customers, with our total customer base now \n\nbeing just short of 6,000. Besides continued success \n\nin the corporate sector, we won several long-term, \n\nlarge-value contracts in the public sector, including \n\nthe NHS and HMRC. The new five-year agreement with \n\nthe NHS, for example, has a sales value of £775 million \n\nover the life of the contract, supporting our longer-term \n\ngrowth ambitions. We have a track record of growing \n\nthe profitability of these contracts over time, and \n\nopening up other software, hardware and \n\nservice opportunities. \n\nEven after our impressive GII growth of 26.7% \n\nthis year, our share of the overall total addressable \n\nmarket in the UK is still less than 4%. This, along with \n\nour high customer net promoter score of 82, gives \n\nus a lot of confidence that we can keep winning new \n\ncustomers, while deepening relationships with those \n\nwe already serve. \n\nThe potential of tools supported by AI \n\nIn our sector, agility is crucial: when new technologies \n\nemerge, we must be ready to help customers prepare \n\nfor and adapt to them. We have already seen strong \n\ninterest from our customers in AI-enabled software \n\nsolutions, such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, which use \n\nthe power of large language models and a user’s data to \n\nhelp improve productivity. And while we understand their \n\nexcitement, we’re also urging caution. We believe that \n\ncareful consideration and planning is essential before \n\nimplementing AI products. This includes putting in \n\nplace the right guidelines, frameworks and guard rails \n\nfor data protection and security, and providing training \n\nfor users. By doing things in the right sequence, the \n\npositive outcomes can be far greater. \n\nWe’ve been following this approach ourselves, \n\nwhich will help us provide even better support to our \n\ncustomers. During the last few months of the year, \n\n100 people at BTG, including myself and many of \n\nour senior managers, enrolled in Microsoft’s early \n\naccess programme for Copilot. As we advance our \n\nunderstanding of these tools, we are very optimistic \n\nabout the technology, and plan to gradually roll it \n\nout to the majority of our employees in line with the \n\nconsidered approach that we advise our customers \n\nto take. We believe that, over time, adopting AI in this \n\nmeasured, careful way will make our organisation \n\nmore productive, help us respond more quickly to \n\nour customers and other stakeholders, free up time \n\nfor creativity and innovation, and give us a head start \n\nin advising customers on how to implement Copilot. \n\nUltimately, then, our approach positions us well to be \n\na leader in the implementation of AI and so drive our \n\ngrowth for the rest of the decade, and beyond. When \n\nwe look back at this pivotal moment in years to come, \n\nwe will have played our role in helping our customers \n\nto benefit from this new wave of technology. \n\n# Investment case \n\nProven track record and growth strategy \n\nWe have a long track record of delivering strong financial \n\nperformance, enabled by highly motivated employees delivering \n\nthe latest technology to a diverse and loyal customer base. \n\nOur strategy is to grow organically by doing more with existing \n\ncustomers and winning new customers – this supports strong \n\nfree cash flow that allows us to invest in our businesses. \n\n6-year GP compound average growth rate \n\n# 18% \n\nCustomers served in 2023/24 \n\n# 5,978 \n\nAttractive market positioning \n\nWe have strategic relationships and partnerships with many \n\nof the world’s leading software vendors and distribution \n\nchannels. This includes a long and deeply embedded \n\nrelationship with Microsoft, as one of its largest partners \n\nin the UK by revenue. \n\nNumber of vendors and distributors \n\n# >800 \n\nOne of the biggest UK partners with Microsoft by revenue \n\nCompelling growth opportunity \n\nWe operate in a vast, growing market, boosted by technological \n\ntailwinds from digital transformation agendas, cloud products, \n\ncybersecurity and AI-enabled tools. Our share of our total \n\naddressable market is less than 4%, so we have plenty of \n\nroom to grow. \n\nStrong GII growth \n\n# 26.7% \n\nStrong team culture \n\nOur dynamic culture drives our operational excellence \n\nand high employee retention rates. Our culture also \n\nincreases sales productivity, customer satisfaction and repeat \n\nbusiness. \n\nEmployee net promoter score \n\n# 71 \n\n04 \n\n03 \n\n02 \n\n01 \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n7CEO’s review continued \n\nStaying true to our culture \n\nDriving growth is only possible with a brilliant, highly \n\nengaged team with a can-do attitude. When BTG \n\nwas formed at our IPO in December 2020 we were \n\n650 people; this year we celebrated passing the \n\n1,000-employee mark, attracting great talent in \n\na competitive market for skills. During the year, our \n\nheadcount grew by 13.7% as we looked to make \n\nsure we have the right number of people with the \n\nright technical and commercial skills for where \n\nthe market will be in the coming years. \n\nThough we have grown significantly over the \n\nyears, we’re always mindful of the importance of \n\nmaintaining the ‘family’ culture that has brought us \n\nso much success. That means recognising every \n\nemployee as an individual who needs to be guided, \n\nmotivated, challenged and offered a clear career \n\npath. We encourage a workplace culture where \n\nemployees gain value and personal satisfaction \n\nfrom their work. This can lead to substantial benefits \n\nfor both individual and organisation, and promote \n\nwellbeing and productivity. We continually aim to \n\ncreate an environment where these outcomes can be \n\nachieved and where people can thrive and be fulfilled. \n\nOur approach to flexible working is one example of \n\nhow we do this. Some companies, including in the \n\ntechnology sector, prefer their staff back in the office \n\nfull time. In contrast, we believe that face-to-face \n\ninteraction and collaboration is important to maintain \n\nour culture, and we have plenty of people who are \n\nin the office five days a week, because they like the \n\nenvironment and work well that way. But we have others \n\nwho prefer to work from home for part of the week, \n\nbecause it suits their personality and circumstances \n\nor the type of work they do. We learnt during the \n\npandemic that everyone will find their own best way \n\nof working, and of being productive. As long as it \n\ncontinues to deliver the right results, then we’re happy. \n\nDeepening ties with our vendors \n\nJust like with our people, building lasting \n\nrelationships is crucial when it comes to our many \n\nvendors, including our largest and longest-standing \n\npartner, Microsoft, with which we continued to \n\ndeepen our relationship this year. I was really \n\npleased to get the opportunity to meet Microsoft’s \n\nCEO, Satya Nadella, and many senior Microsoft \n\nexecutives when I went to Seattle for the awards \n\nceremony for Phoenix winning Microsoft Global \n\nModern Endpoint Management Partner of the Year \n\nfor 2023. By working closely with our vendors over \n\nmany years, and investing in our capabilities to stay \n\nahead of the technology curve, we benefit from early \n\naccess to new product development, such as Copilot. \n\nWe also get to take part in high-level discussions that \n\nhelp influence our strategic thinking and awareness \n\nof market opportunities. \n\nThis year, we strengthened our partnership with \n\nCloud Bridge Technologies, an Amazon Web \n\nServices (AWS) partner. In April 2023, we acquired \n\nan interest in Cloud Bridge, and this investment gives \n\nus access to resources that will help underpin our \n\nmulticloud strategy in the coming years. \n\nStrengthening our commitment \n\nto the environment \n\nAnother area in which we look to the outside world, \n\nand the expectations of businesses today, is \n\nsustainability. The environment, and climate change \n\nin particular, is becoming an ever-bigger issue for all \n\nbusinesses – and rightly so, as the world looks for a \n\nmanageable transition to net zero. We’re particularly \n\nmindful of the impact on the environment of growth in \n\ntechnologies like AI, which require vast computing \n\npower and cloud storage and consume a lot of \n\nenergy. And so, while as a company we’re not a big \n\ncarbon emitter, we’re doing everything we can to \n\nmitigate our impact. I’m pleased with our progress \n\nthis year: we expanded our Scope 3 reporting, \n\nand submitted our carbon reduction targets to \n\nthe Science Based Targets initiative for validation. \n\nThe road ahead \n\nI’m excited about the prospects for 2024/25 as we \n\ncontinue to work with our customers to be more \n\nproductive through advancements in technology. \n\nWe believe that tailwinds will continue to favour our \n\nindustry, as companies look to the latest technologies, \n\nincluding AI, to become more efficient, and as \n\nthe cybersecurity threat continues to grow. More \n\nimportant to us, however, are the investments and \n\ninnovations we’re making to support that growth: \n\nincreasing our technical skills, expanding our teams \n\nwhile maintaining our strong culture, strengthening \n\nour vendor relationships and building new services \n\nand solutions. Together, these investments are setting \n\nus up strongly for the years to come, and I look \n\nforward to the future with great optimism. \n\nSam Mudd \n\nCEO \n\n22 May 2024   \n\n> 8Bytes Technology Group plc\n> OUR BUSINESS\n\n# Our business model \n\nWhat we do \n\nWe’re a value-added IT reseller, focusing on cloud and security software developed by leading vendors. \n\nWe also provide professional and managed IT services, and hardware, to deliver complete tailored solutions. \n\nBytes Technology Group \n\ncomprises two independent and \n\ncomplementary operating companies. \n\nBytes Software Services \n\nfocuses on corporate enterprise clients, \n\nsmall to medium-sized businesses and \n\npublic sector customers. \n\nPhoenix Software \n\nserves mainly public sector customers. \n\nOur corporate centre drives strategy and provides guidance and support on finance, governance, \n\nlegal compliance, and sustainability, ensuring our organisation’s smooth operation and success. \n\nWhy we’re different How we do it differently \n\nWe build lasting, mutually beneficial partnerships with \n\nour employees, customers and vendors – this enables \n\nus to achieve consistent growth. \n\nWe live by our values in all we do: be passionate, act \n\nwith integrity, work together, be kind and respectful, \n\nget business done and have fun doing it. \n\nOur people \n\nWe employ people who are passionate about technology and \n\nour customers, including many who are long serving and have \n\na high level of technical skills. \n\nOur experience and expertise \n\nWith more than 30 years of serving the UK IT market, \n\nwe have accumulated vast knowledge and expertise. \n\nOur leadership team is highly experienced. \n\nOur vendors and broad product portfolio \n\nWe have deep relationships with many of the world’s biggest \n\nsoftware companies.

Our \n\ncustomers’ great experiences with us encouraged many \n\nto highly recommend our services, with our customer net \n\npromoter score (NPS) increasing from 77 to 82, high by \n\nindustry standards. \n\nInvesting in our people and our business \n\nOur people drive our success: we need to retain our exceptional employees to continue to sell effectively, \n\nand to meet our growth ambitions we need to keep increasing our headcount. \n\nThis means we: \n\n•• Work continually to develop, engage and fulfil our people \n\n•• Maintain a dynamic, supportive and fun culture \n\n•• Remain alert for potential acquisitions that would \n\ncomplement our offering and support our strategy. \n\nThis year: \n\nWe grew our headcount by almost 13.7% and expanded \n\nour training and development programmes. Employee \n\nsatisfaction remained stable with an eNPS of 71, and staff \n\nturnover was low. We acquired a 25.1% interest in AWS \n\npartner Cloud Bridge Technologies, which will complement \n\nour multicloud business, offering both Microsoft and AWS \n\ncloud options according to what fits best with our customers. \n\nInvesting in innovation \n\nFrom AI to cybersecurity, technology is advancing rapidly. We invest in innovation to help our customers \n\nstay ahead of the pace of change, manage the risks and make the most of the benefits. \n\nThis means we: \n\n•• Monitor market trends and develop innovative IT \n\nsolutions that meet customers’ evolving needs and help \n\nthem update or supplement their technology \n\n•• Invest in our technical capabilities to be able to give the \n\nbest advice and support \n\n•• Advance our knowledge and expertise by partnering with \n\nspecialist providers, updating our training and hiring \n\nemployees with specific skills. \n\nThis year: \n\nWe continued to invest in the multicloud environment, which \n\nenables organisations to use the cloud systems of more than \n\none vendor, giving them more flexibility to control costs and \n\noptimise performance. By rolling out Microsoft’s Copilot AI \n\ntool to a number of our employees, we improved our own \n\nways of working and our understanding of the technology. \n\nAnd we enhanced our managed security services offerings, \n\nwhich have been in high demand with our customers. \n\nOur strategy works because we focus relentlessly on: \n\n•• Providing – and being experts in – great value, innovative IT products and services that customers need \n\n•• Identifying and targeting those customers \n\n•• Being straightforward and enjoyable to do business with. \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n11 Our market environment \n\n# The resilience of the technology market was again on show in 2023/24. \n\n# Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, spending on IT \n\n# continued to grow, as businesses looked to technology to make them \n\n# more efficient, more productive and more secure.

There is a strong \n\nfocus on maximising value and, at the \n\nsame time, controlling costs. This plays to \n\nour strengths, because we always focus on \n\nwhat organisations need, not what we want \n\nto sell. Customers are seeking flexibility, so \n\nthey can quickly respond to changes in the \n\nbusiness environment. Cloud computing, \n\nwhere the costs can be variable, is \n\nattractive for this reason, as is hybrid \n\ninfrastructure, which offers a mix of on-site \n\nand cloud-based systems. Managed \n\nservices, in particular security, are also \n\nbecoming increasingly popular, as the \n\nexpertise required to protect companies \n\nfrom cyberattacks continues to grow. All of \n\nthis means we are being asked to provide \n\nmore guidance and support to customers \n\n– which is why we keep growing our teams \n\nand investing in our technical capabilities. \n\nHow we fit into the UK technology sector \n\nWe’re one of the UK’s leading value-added resellers (VARs), \n\nproviding IT products from a broad range of technology \n\nvendors to a large and diversified base of corporate and \n\npublic sector organisations. Our potential market is large. \n\nUK business-to-business customers buy the majority of \n\ntheir technology products from VARs and other resellers \n\nand distributors. Currently, our share of the UK VAR business \n\nis still in single digits. And because no one company \n\ndominates the market, we have a lot of room to expand. \n\nFor vendors, there are several advantages to selling through \n\ncompanies like ours, rather than directly to customers. \n\nWe can promote their products using our skilled salesforce, \n\nmarket to thousands of customers, advise on latest customer \n\nrequirements and work on promotional campaigns with them. \n\nOur partnerships with vendors also benefit our customers \n\nbecause the discounts and rebates we receive from the \n\nvendors enable us to charge lower prices. This saves money \n\nfor our customers and deepens our relationships with them. \n\nCase study \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n13 Advising \n\n# our customers \n\n# Helping CFC Underwriting \n\n# boost its cybersecurity \n\nIt’s great working with Bytes. It feels like we are two companies that are closely aligned \n\n– they understand what we are trying to achieve and our goals over the next few years. \n\nAndy Clarke, Technology Operations Manager, CFC Underwriting \n\nCFC Underwriting delivers specialist insurance products \n\nand is trusted by more than 130,000 businesses around \n\nthe world. Like many businesses after the pandemic, \n\nCFC had embraced hybrid working, with employees \n\noperating from home and in the company’s offices in \n\nthe UK and overseas. But the existing technology \n\ninfrastructure did not adequately support this new \n\nway of working, especially when it came to security. \n\n‘We did not have the resilience we needed for our business, \n\nand we wanted greater visibility of our network traffic,’ says \n\nAndy Clarke, Technology Operations Manager at CFC. \n\n‘We needed something that would meet our current \n\nchallenges and scale with us as we grow our business. \n\nThat’s the reason we reached out to Bytes.’ \n\nThe Bytes team set about understanding what was needed \n\nfrom a technical, commercial and time perspective. Together \n\nwith CFC, they agreed that the best solution was a ‘Secure \n\nAccess Service Edge’, or SASE, a cloud-based architecture \n\nthat delivers network and security services to protect users, \n\ndata and applications. \n\nGuiseppe Damiano, pre-sales solution consultant at Bytes, \n\nsaid a second big consideration was ensuring the proposed \n\ntechnology ‘would not disrupt the existing environment, \n\nusers and applications. You want to solve the problem at \n\nhand without introducing any new ones.’ \n\nUsing their expertise and understanding of the business, the \n\nBytes team was able to identify the suitable vendors before \n\nmoving ahead with the implementation of the SASE. The \n\nresult? Another highly satisfied customer that considers \n\nBytes as ‘our trusted partner’. \n\n14 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nFEATURE Using modern technology to make \n\n# council services more accessible \n\nBeing able to work flexibly is really important because my job is all around people and \n\nnot everyone is available between nine and five. It enables me to be able to deliver the \n\nservice to those people. \n\nKaren Sweeney, Senior Homelessness Prevention & Intervention Officer, St Helens Borough Council \n\nPhoenix has worked with St Helens Borough Council for \n\nyears. When the council wanted to realise the benefits \n\nof using modern technology, Phoenix worked \n\nalongside it to implement the solutions it needed. \n\nThe council created a detailed ‘ways of working’ \n\nprogramme to highlight the areas it needed to focus on to \n\nimprove processes and inclusivity. Phoenix supported this \n\njourney, ensuring the modernisation of St Helens Borough \n\nCouncil’s infrastructure, devices and data platforms. With \n\nan alignment of Microsoft Power BI and SQL, the processes \n\nare now simpler and more effective, for the benefit of its \n\nemployees and the residents they serve. \n\n‘Having Phoenix as a trusted partner from a strategic \n\nperspective is really important,’ says Ste Sharples, \n\nAssistant Director, People Management, ICT and Digital, \n\nSt Helens Borough Council. ‘I can approach them on a \n\ntechnical level and that trusted relationship we have had over \n\nthe years means I am guaranteed to get the right advice.’ \n\nFollowing the process improvements, Phoenix provided \n\nthe council with a simple rollout of Microsoft Surface \n\ndevices, Azure cloud infrastructure and Microsoft 365. \n\nSince implementation, these products have driven cost \n\nsavings, improved sustainability practices and increased \n\ncollaboration. \n\nCraig Taylor, Director of Cloud Solutions at Phoenix, says \n\nthe relationship between St Helens, Microsoft and Phoenix \n\nwas critical to the success of the project. ‘It’s resulted in \n\nexcellent staff and citizen engagement, and I think a lot of \n\ncouncils can learn from St Helens because they have done \n\nit with such conviction.’ \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n15 Financial \n\n# Measuring progress \n\n# We track our progress against financial, \n\n# strategic and sustainability KPIs. \n\nGross invoiced income (GII) 1 £1,823.0m +26.7% Revenue 2, 3 £207.0m +12.3% \n\n2024 £1,823.0m \n\n2023 £1,439.3m \n\n2022 £1,208.1m \n\n2021 £958.1m \n\n2024 £207.0m \n\n2023 £184.4m \n\n2022 £145.8m \n\n2021 £393.6m \n\nAdjusted operating profit (AOP) 4 £63.3m +12.2% Gross profit (GP) £145.8m +12.5% \n\n2024 £63.3m \n\n2023 £56.4m \n\n2022 £46.3m \n\n2021 £37.5m \n\n2024 £145.8m \n\n2023 £129.6m \n\n2022 £107.4m \n\n2021 £89.6m \n\nOperating profit £56.7m +11.4% Cash £88.8m +21.6% \n\n2024 £56.7m \n\n2023 £50.9m \n\n2022 £42.2m \n\n2021 £26.8m \n\n2024 £88.8m \n\n2023 £73.0m \n\n2022 £67.1m \n\n2021 £20.7m \n\nGross margin 3 70.4% AOP as a percentage of gross profit 43.4% \n\n2024 70.4% \n\n2023 70.3% \n\n2022 73.7% \n\n2021 22.8% \n\n2024 43.4% \n\n2023 43.5% \n\n2022 43.2% \n\n2021 41.8% \n\nCash conversion 5 104.3% \n\n2024 104.3% \n\n2023 84.3% \n\n2022 131.9% \n\n2021 130.7% \n\n1 ‘Gross invoiced income’ is a non-IFRS financial measure that reflects gross income billed to customers, adjusted for deferred and accrued revenue items. \n\nThe reconciliation of gross invoiced income to revenue is set out in note 3(b) to the consolidated financial statements. \n\n2 ‘Revenue’ is reported in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

This allowed us to \n\n# achieve good financial results, despite uncertainty in the broader market. \n\nI am proud of the efforts of the team across BTG that \n\nallowed us to increase our gross profit by 12.5% to \n\n£145.8 million in 2023/24, and our gross invoiced \n\nincome by 26.7% to £1.8 billion. We grew our adjusted \n\noperating profit by 12.2% to £63.3 million and ended \n\nthe year with strong cash conversion at 104.3%. \n\nBroadening our customer base \n\nwith notable contract wins \n\nOur track record of service excellence helped \n\nus achieve our goal of doing more business with \n\neach customer this year. Gross profit from existing \n\ncustomers increased by £11.1 million, these \n\ncustomers making up 97% of our total gross profit. \n\nThe balance of our gross profit growth at £5.1 million \n\ncame from new customers, supporting our overall \n\nstrategy of doing more with existing customers \n\nand winning new ones. \n\nOne of the highlights this year was winning several \n\nmajor, multi-year contracts with government \n\norganisations, including the NHS and HMRC. \n\nThis supports our long-term sales strategy and adds \n\nto our strong repeat (annuity) income. While these \n\ncontracts are typically won at reduced margins due \n\nto the competitive nature of the tenders, we are \n\nconfident that they will open up additional software, \n\nhardware and service opportunities over time. \n\nThe growth this year was spread across the business, \n\nwith the gross invoiced income in software, services \n\nand hardware increasing by 27.9%, 8.6% and 8.1% \n\nrespectively. We grew by 17.6% in the corporate \n\nsector, and by 32.8% in the public sector. Our \n\ncontinued disciplined approach to cost management \n\nand operating efficiency is evidenced by our adjusted \n\noperating profit (AOP) to gross profit (GP) ratio of \n\n43.4% (2022/23 43.5%). \n\nAndrew Holden \n\nCFO \n\n20 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nREVIEW OF THE YEAR Continued robust demand in our market \n\nThe world in general this year was marked by \n\nuncertainty and unease. The war in Ukraine \n\ncontinued and conflict erupted in the Middle East. \n\nInflation started to fall but interest rates did not. \n\nWhile these issues have had no material impact \n\non our business so far, we continue to keep a close \n\neye on the external environment while it remains \n\nso uncertain. We did see some reticence about \n\ncommitting to new investments in hardware, but \n\nbecause of our heavy focus on software, a largely \n\nsubscription model that accounts for around 94% \n\nof our business, this did not noticeably affect us. \n\nIndeed, demand from public sector customers and \n\ncorporate customers from all sectors remained \n\nrobust, as organisations sought to boost their \n\nefficiency and productivity through technology. \n\nInvesting for future growth \n\nOur biggest investment is in people. As a consistently \n\ngrowing business, we need to attract and retain the \n\nright people so we can maintain our high levels of \n\nservice as our customer base expands. During \n\n2023/24 we increased our headcount by 13.7%, \n\nfrom 930 to 1,057 across the business, including \n\nsales and support, which came on top of a 20.3% \n\nheadcount increase in the previous financial year. \n\nWe spent a lot of time and effort on integrating \n\nand training our new employees, making sure they \n\nunderstood our culture, which is integral to our \n\nbusiness. It’s about high performance and high \n\nreward as well as flexibility and enjoyment. We \n\ninvested in our existing workforce too. Besides \n\ntraining, this included identifying and promoting \n\ntalented people into leadership roles, to give \n\nus the right managers for the larger team. \n\nWe also invested in our workspaces and our cloud \n\ncapabilities. In March 2023, we opened an office in \n\nthe City of London, bringing us closer to prospective \n\nemployees and customers, and in April 2023 we \n\nacquired a 25.1% interest in Cloud Bridge Technologies, \n\nan AWS partner, as part of our multicloud strategy. \n\nLooking ahead \n\nThanks to all the investments in people and systems \n\nthat we’ve made in recent years, as well as our strong \n\nculture and the positive trends in our sector, I’m \n\nconfident we will be able to keep expanding our \n\nbusiness in the coming year. However, we know that \n\nas we grow, processes and internal controls need to \n\nevolve too so that they keep in step with the larger \n\nbusiness. Since we listed the company in 2020, we \n\nhave been taking ongoing steps to strengthen our \n\nprocesses and internal controls, including around \n\nrisk and governance, and embedding them into \n\nthe new systems we are implementing in 2024/25. \n\nThis will include increased automation and greater \n\nefficiency in a number of areas as we increase \n\nour volume of business. \n\nAndrew Holden \n\nCFO \n\n22 May 2024 \n\n## Demand from corporate \n\n## and public sector customers, \n\n## across all sectors, remained \n\n## robust as organisations sought \n\n## to boost their efficiency and \n\n## productivity through technology. \n\nStrong cash management \n\nWe are fortunate to operate in an environment \n\nwhere, for the most part, customers pay us \n\nbefore we are required to pay our suppliers. \n\nThis means we don’t have to borrow to fund \n\nour growth and carry a certain amount of cash \n\non the balance sheet on a day-to-day basis. \n\nBy actively managing our cash reserves on the \n\nmoney markets this year, when bank deposit \n\nrates rose to more than 5%, we earned \n\n£5.1 million in interest. This offset the increase \n\nin our tax charge which was due to both growth \n\nin profits and the rise in the corporate tax rate \n\nfrom 19% to 25% towards the start of our financial \n\nyear. As a result, our EPS has grown by 15.8%. \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n21 Operational review \n\n# Our two complementary businesses share one culture, and \n\n# deep commitment to our people, our customers and our vendors. \n\n# In 2023/24, this again proved to be a winning formula. Both Bytes \n\n# and Phoenix expanded on all fronts as we increased our customer \n\n# numbers, headcount, gross profit and our offerings. \n\nStrong demand from the \n\ncorporate and public sectors \n\nAmid robust demand from existing and \n\nnew customers, Bytes and Phoenix grew \n\nstrongly across software, hardware and \n\nservices, led by: \n\n•• Security – as cyberattacks and \n\nthreats continue to mount, businesses \n\ncontinue to invest in a wide array of \n\nadvanced tools and managed security \n\nservices, to strengthen their defences \n\n•• Subscription software – most \n\nsoftware contracts are now based \n\non subscriptions, rather than one-off \n\nlicences, providing a strong \n\nannuity-based revenue stream \n\n•• Cloud-based solutions –\n\norganisations continue to migrate their \n\nsystems to the cloud while also seeking \n\nto manage costs and take advantage \n\nof the latest cloud-based technologies, \n\nincluding AI, which bolsters our annuity \n\nbusiness given its repeat nature \n\n•• Hybrid infrastructure – to better \n\nmanage their entire IT ecosystem, \n\nbusinesses combine the security and \n\ncontrol of on-site data centres with \n\nthe flexibility of cloud services \n\n•• IT services – increasingly advanced \n\ntechnology has led to greater demand \n\nfor expert support, from security to \n\ncompliance, both on a project basis \n\nand via annual support contracts. \n\nInnovating to provide even \n\nbetter service and solutions \n\nAs our customer base expands, we need \n\nto be innovative to maintain our high level \n\nof service, and to create new solutions to \n\nhelp our clients get the most out of the \n\nlatest technology. A good example of \n\nthis is Bytes’ Marketplace platforms. \n\nExtending this offering from the existing \n\nMicrosoft CSP platform, both businesses \n\nhave added Adobe Marketplace in \n\n2023/24. These platforms offer a one-stop \n\nshop that allows customers to self-serve \n\ntheir Microsoft and Adobe subscriptions, \n\ngiving them greater control and clarity \n\nover costs and a more personalised \n\nexperience, while Bytes continues to \n\nmanage the order processing and billing. \n\nPhoenix, meanwhile, has boosted its \n\ntechnical capabilities and professional \n\nservices. This includes the governance, \n\nrisk and compliance service, which helps \n\norganisations to keep their users and \n\ntheir clients safe from the risk of data \n\ncompromise and regulatory breaches. \n\nBoth Bytes and Phoenix continued to \n\ndevelop their strong managed security \n\nservices, in partnership with leading \n\nvendors, as the risk of cyberattacks \n\ncontinues to increase. \n\nUsing AI tools to boost \n\nour productivity and help \n\nour customers boost theirs \n\nAs a Group, we were invited by Microsoft \n\nto form part of its early access programme \n\nfor Copilot, the AI-supported tool that \n\nuses large language models and an \n\norganisation’s data to boost productivity. \n\nOne hundred of our employees – 50 each \n\nfrom Bytes and Phoenix – started using \n\nthe premium version of Copilot during the \n\nyear, learning how it could help them in \n\ntheir day-to-day tasks. \n\nWhile this is good for us internally, it also \n\ngave us valuable experience and insights \n\nbefore rolling out the product to our \n\ncustomers, who have expressed great \n\ninterest in the technology. Bytes and \n\nPhoenix each held webinars for existing \n\nand prospective customers about Copilot, \n\nwith more than 2,000 people registering to \n\nattend. We believe AI products, including \n\nGenAI, which enables users to quickly \n\ncreate content, will be a big driver for \n\nour business in the years ahead. \n\nWhat Bytes and Phoenix share: \n\n•• BTG’s values, strategic ambitions, \n\ngovernance structures \n\n•• Insights and good practice \n\n•• Industry-leading skills \n\n•• Can-do culture \n\n•• Representation and engagement in Group \n\nExecutive Committee and steering committees \n\n•• Comparable products and services. \n\nThe businesses have their own: \n\n•• Identities \n\n•• Management teams \n\n•• Individual but complementary routes to market \n\n•• Customer bases and markets \n\n•• Offices. \n\n22 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nREVIEW OF THE YEAR Expanding our teams and \n\nstrengthening our culture \n\nWe’ve continued to invest in our teams to \n\nserve our ever-growing business, passing \n\nthe 1,000-employee mark for the first time. \n\nThe headcount at Bytes and Phoenix rose \n\nby 14% and 13% respectively, impressive \n\nnumbers in a competitive job market.

For that reason, we try not to depend too much \n\non specific customers. In 2023/24, no single customer \n\nrepresented more than 1% of our gross profit. \n\nA trusted partner to our customers \n\nWe’re dedicated to helping our customers use the latest technology \n\nto improve their businesses. It’s about much more than just greater \n\nproductivity and efficiency; we also want to save them money, \n\nsecure their systems and data as cyberattacks increase, and make \n\nthem more sustainable in a world threatened by climate change. Our \n\ncustomers choose Bytes and Phoenix, and stay with us, because: \n\n•• We always act in their best interest. We don’t sell to \n\ncustomers what we want – we provide what they need. \n\n•• We understand their business. Our people are experts in \n\na broad range of the latest technology.

Customers have continued to engage with \n\nus to support their move into the cloud, or to extend their presence \n\nin it, with demand for more sophisticated and resilient security, \n\nsupport and managed service solutions. \n\nThis has resulted in operating profit increasing by 11.4% to \n\n£56.7 million (2022/23: £50.9 million) and AOP growing by 12.2% \n\nyear on year from £56.4 million to £63.3 million. The adjusted \n\noperating profit excludes the impact of amortisation of acquired \n\nintangible assets and share-based payment charges, which do \n\nnot reflect the underlying day-to-day performance of the Group. \n\nGross invoiced income (GII) \n\nGII reflects gross income billed to our customers, with some small \n\nadjustments for deferred and accrued items (mainly relating to \n\nmanaged service contracts where the income is recognised over \n\ntime). We believe that GII is the most useful measure to evaluate our \n\nsales performance, volume of transactions and rate of growth. GII \n\nhas a direct influence on our movements in working capital, reflects \n\nour risks and demonstrates the performance of our sales teams. \n\nTherefore, it is the income measure that is most recognisable \n\namong our staff, and we believe most relevant to our customers, \n\nsuppliers, investors and shareholders for them to understand \n\nour business. \n\nGII has increased by 26.7% year on year, with growth spread \n\nacross all the business’s income streams, but most significantly \n\nfor software, which remains the core focus, contributing 94% of \n\nthe total GII for the year (2022/23: 94%). The Group’s already \n\nsubstantial presence in the public sector has been bolstered by \n\nseveral very large strategic wins relating to government Microsoft \n\nEnterprise Agreements. The Group bids under highly competitive \n\ntenders, either for single contracts or for several public body \n\ncontracts in aggregate, the latter enabling us to gain multiple \n\nnew clients from a single bid process. \n\nThis continued high level of government investment in IT, and the \n\nGroup’s success in winning those new contracts, has resulted in \n\nour public sector GII increasing by £280.9 million, up 32.8%, to \n\n£1,137.5 million (2022/23: £856.6 million). Our corporate GII \n\nincreased by £102.7 million to £685.5 million (2022/23: \n\n£582.7 million), representing a very pleasing rise of 17.6%. \n\nThis means that our overall GII mix has moved slightly compared \n\nto last year, with 62% in public sector (2022/23: 60%) against \n\ncorporate of 38% (2022/23: 40%). \n\nRevenue \n\nRevenue is reported in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue \n\nfrom Contracts with Customers. Under this reporting standard, \n\nwe are required to exercise judgement to determine whether the \n\nGroup is acting as principal or agent in performing its contractual \n\nobligations. Revenue in respect of contracts for which the Group is \n\ndetermined to be acting as an agent is recognised on a ‘net’ basis, \n\nthat is, the gross profit achieved on the contract and not the gross \n\nincome billed to the customer. \n\nOur judgements around this area are set out in notes 1.4 and 1.10 \n\nof the full-year financial statements for 2023/24 but in summary, \n\nsoftware and external services revenue is treated on an agency basis \n\nwhile hardware and internal services revenue is treated as principal. \n\nIt should be noted that GII, gross profit, operating profit, and profit \n\nbefore and after taxes are not affected by these judgements, and \n\nneither are the consolidated statements of financial position, cash \n\nflows and changes in equity. \n\nWith the significant increase in software GII, as noted above, and a \n\nsqueeze on software margin as noted below, its treatment on a net, \n\nor agency, basis, means that the 12.3% increase in revenue in the \n\nyear is therefore lower than the rise in GII. \n\nGross profit (GP) \n\nGross profit increased by 12.5% to £145.8 million \n\n(2022/23: £129.6 million). \n\nThis growth is less than that for GII given the high level of new or \n\nrenewed GII derived from the public sector and the highly competitive \n\nnature of the tendering process, governed under the Crown \n\nCommercial Services framework agreements. This has meant that \n\nlarge software contracts, most notably with Microsoft, have been won \n\nor renewed at reduced margins. This tends to be particularly prevalent \n\nin the first year of new agreements with public sector entities and, \n\nas a result, we have seen a reduction on our GP/GII% in the year to \n\n8.0% (2022/23: 9.0%). That said, if the impact of the two largest new \n\ncontracts is removed from the calculation, the percentage rises to \n\n8.9%, virtually in line with last year and demonstrating the continued \n\nstrong performance of the business in maintaining its margins. \n\nDeals such as these are consistent with the Group’s strategy of \n\nwinning new customers and then expanding share of wallet. Our \n\nobjective is to ensure we build our profitability within each contract \n\nover its term, typically three to five years, by adding additional \n\nhigher-margin products into the original agreement as the \n\ncustomers’ requirements grow and become more advanced. \n\nAdding AI products such as Copilot will become part of these \n\ncontract expansions going forward. This is further enhanced by \n\nfocusing on selling our wide range of solutions offerings and \n\nhigher-margin security products, while maximising our vendor \n\nincentives through achievement of technical certifications. We \n\ntrack these customers individually to ensure that the strategy \n\ndelivers value for the business, and our other stakeholders, \n\nover the duration of the contracts. \n\nOur long-standing relationships with our customers and high levels \n\nof repeat business was again demonstrated in 2023/24 with 97% \n\nof our GP coming from customers that we also traded with last year \n\n(2022/23: 96%), at a renewal rate of 109% (which measures the \n\nGP from existing customers this period compared to total GP in the \n\nprior period). This demonstrates our ability to increase our share \n\nof wallet with average GP per customer growing from £21,800 in \n\n2022/23 to £24,400 in 2023/24. \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n27 Financial review continued \n\nAdministrative expenses \n\nThis includes employee costs and other administrative \n\nexpenses as set out below. \n\nEmployee costs \n\nOur success in growing GII and GP continues to be as a direct result \n\nof the investments we have made over years in our front-line sales \n\nteams, vendor and technology specialists, service delivery staff and \n\ntechnical support personnel, backed up by our marketing, operations, \n\nand finance teams. It has been, and will remain, a carefully managed \n\naspect of our business. \n\nIn addition to continuing to hire in line with growth and to ensure \n\nwe have the expertise required to provide our clients with the best \n\nservice, our commitment to develop, promote and expand from \n\nwithin the existing employee base, giving our people careers rather \n\nthan just employment, is at the heart of our progress as a business. \n\nThis has contributed to long tenure from our employees which in \n\nturn supports the long relationships we have established with our \n\ncustomers, vendors, and partners. This is at the very heart of our \n\nlow employee churn rate, the growth in gross profit per customer \n\nand our high customer retention rate. \n\nDuring the year we have seen total staff numbers rise above 1,000 \n\nfor the first time, to 1,057 on our February 2024 payroll, up by 13.7% \n\nfrom the year-end position of 930 on 28 February 2023. Employee \n\ncosts included in administrative expenses rose by 12.5% to \n\n£71.2 million (2022/23: £63.3 million), in line with our GP growth \n\nand reflecting the balanced and proportional way in which staff \n\ninvestments are made. Indeed, after excluding share-based payments \n\nof £5.7 million (2022/23: £4.2 million), the rise was lower at 10.8%. \n\nOther administrative expenses \n\nOther administrative expenses increased by 16.2% to £17.9 million \n\n(2022/23: £15.4 million). This increase included additional spend \n\non internal systems, professional fees, staff welfare and travel \n\ncosts. This reflects the costs of running, and investing in, a growing \n\norganisation and in operating a listed Group, including evolving our \n\ngovernance structure, controls, and processes with the support of \n\nour professional advisors. \n\nAdjusted operating profit and operating profit \n\nAdjusted operating profit excludes, from operating profit, the effects of: \n\n•• Share-based payment charges because, while new employee \n\nshare schemes are being launched, the charge to the income \n\nstatement will increase each year. Accordingly, the charge \n\nfor the current year has risen to £5.7 million, compared \n\nto £4.2 million last year. \n\n•• Amortisation of acquired intangibles because this cost only \n\nappears as a consolidation item and does not arise from \n\nordinary operating activities. \n\nWe believe that adjusted operating profit is a meaningful measure \n\nthat the Board can use to effectively evaluate our profitability, \n\nperformance, and ongoing quality of earnings. Adjusted operating \n\nprofit in 2023/24 increased to £63.3 million (2022/23: £56.4 million), \n\nrepresenting growth of 12.2%. Our operating profit increased from \n\n£50.9 million to £56.7 million, equating to an increase of 11.4%. \n\nAdjusted operating profit as a percentage of GP is one of the \n\nGroup’s key alternative performance indicators, being a measure \n\nof the Group’s operational effectiveness in running day-to-day \n\noperations. We aim to sustain it in excess of 40% and have \n\nachieved this, with a ratio of 43.4% (2022/23: 43.5%). \n\nInterest receivable and finance costs \n\nThis year has seen significant interest being earned from money \n\nmarket deposits, totalling £5.1 million (2022/23: nil). \n\nOur finance costs largely comprise arrangement and commitment \n\nfees associated to our revolving credit facility (RCF), noting that to date \n\nthe Group has not drawn down any amount. This balance also includes \n\na small amount of finance lease interest on our right-of-use assets, \n\nincluding the introduction of a staff electric vehicle (EV) scheme. \n\nShare of profit in associate \n\nFollowing the acquisition of a 25.1% interest in Cloud Bridge \n\nTechnologies in April 2023, in accordance with IAS 28 Investments \n\nin Associates we have accounted for the Group’s share of its profits \n\nsince the date of our investment, £0.2 million for the 11-month period. \n\nProfit before tax \n\nThe combined impact of increased operating profits and high levels \n\nof interest received has seen our profit before tax increasing by an \n\nimpressive 22.2% to £61.6 million (2022/23: £50.4 million). \n\nIncome tax expense \n\nThe £4.7 million (47.0%) rise in our income tax expense to \n\n£14.7 million (2022/23: £10.0 million) reflects the growth in \n\nprofits described above and the increase in the UK corporate \n\ntax rate from 19% to 25% effective from 1 April 2023. \n\nNevertheless, our effective rate of tax at 23.9% is lower than the \n\ntax charge would be at the standard rate, primarily because of \n\ndeductions available in relation to the share options exercised by \n\nstaff during the year. The reconciliation is set out in note 8 to the \n\nfinancial statements. \n\nProfit after tax \n\nProfit after tax increased by 16.1% to £46.9 million (2022/23: \n\n£40.4 million), underlining our growth in operating profits and \n\nwith the impact of higher taxes more than offset by the increase \n\nin interest income. \n\nEarnings per share \n\nAs a result of this strong growth in profits attributable to owners \n\nof the company (post tax), our earnings per share have risen \n\naccordingly. Basic earnings per share are up 15.8% from \n\n16.88 pence to 19.55 pence, while adjusted earnings per share \n\nhave risen 15.7% to 21.78 pence (2022/23: 18.83 pence). The \n\nadjusted figure removes the effects of share-based payment \n\ncharges and amortisation of intangible assets. \n\n28 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nREVIEW OF THE YEAR Balance sheet and cash flow \n\nBalance sheet \n\n> As at\n> 29 February 2024\n> £’m\n> As at\n> 28 February 2023\n> £’m\n\nInvestment in associate 3.2 –\n\nProperty plant and equipment 8.5 8.4 \n\nIntangible assets 40.6 41.5 \n\nOther non-current assets 4.9 1.2 \n\nNon-current assets 57.2 51.1 \n\nTrade and other receivables 221.8 185.9 \n\nCash 88.8 73.0 \n\nOther current assets 11.8 10.7 \n\nCurrent assets 322.4 269.6 \n\nTrade and other payables 277.9 231.7 \n\nLease liabilities 0.4 0.1 \n\nOther current liabilities 19.6 23.9 \n\nCurrent liabilities 297.9 255.7 \n\nLease liabilities 1.3 0.9 \n\nOther non-current liabilities 2.1 2.6 \n\nNon-current liabilities 3.4 3.5 \n\nNet assets 78.3 61.5 \n\nShare capital 2.4 2.4 \n\nShare premium 633.7 633.6 \n\nShare-based payment reserve 11.0 7.2 \n\nMerger reserve (644.4) (644.4) \n\nRetained earnings 75.6 62.7 \n\nTotal equity 78.3 61.5 \n\nClosing net assets stood at £78.3 million (2022/23: £61.5 million) \n\nincluding the Group’s £3.2 million interest (25.1%) in Cloud Bridge \n\nTechnologies (which includes our £0.2 million share of profits since \n\nit was acquired in April 2023). \n\nNet current assets closed at £24.5 million (2022/23: £13.9 million). \n\nThis includes growth in the trade and other receivables of 19.3%, \n\nand similar growth in trade and other payables of 19.9%, both \n\nreflecting the increase in our GII. \n\nOur debtor days at the end of the year stood at 34, down from \n\n37 at 28 February 2023, and our average debtor days for the year also \n\nreduced to 37 (2022/23: 39). While we have increased our closing \n\nloss allowance provision to £2.5 million (2022/23: £1.5 million), this is \n\na prudent position given the £35.0 million increase in our gross trade \n\nreceivables and, in fact, we have come through the year with only \n\n£0.3 million in bad debt write-offs against total GII of £1.8 billion. \n\nThis strong performance in respect of collecting customer \n\nreceivables has contributed to the positive cash conversion \n\nfigures described below. \n\nThe Group has paid its suppliers on schedule through the year, \n\nwith its average creditor days remaining in line with prior year at 47 \n\nand standing at 44 at the end of the year (2022/23: 42). \n\nThe consolidated cash flow is set out below along with the key flows \n\nwhich that affected it: \n\nCash flow \n\n> Year ended\n> 29 February\n> 2024\n> £’m\n> Year ended\n> 28 February\n> 2023\n> £’m\n\nCash generated from operations 67.3 48.9 \n\nPayments for fixed assets (1.3) (1.3) \n\nFree cash flow 66.0 47.6 \n\nNet interest received/(paid) 4.7 (0.5) \n\nTaxes paid (15.1) (10.3) \n\nLease payments (0.2) (0.2) \n\nDividends (36.6) (30.7) \n\nInvestment in associate (3.0) 0.0 \n\nNet increase in cash 15.8 5.9 \n\nCash at the beginning of the year 73.0 67.1 \n\nCash at the end of the year 88.8 73.0 \n\nAOP 63.3 56.4 \n\nCash conversion (annual) 104.3% 84.3% \n\nCash conversion (since IPO) 109.9% 112.4% \n\nCash at the end of the period was £88.8 million (2022/23: £73.0 million), \n\nwhich is after the payment of dividends totalling £36.6 million during \n\nthe year – being the final and special dividends for 2022/23 and the \n\ninterim dividend for 2023/24 – and after making the £3.0 million \n\ninvestment in Cloud Bridge. \n\nCash flow from operations after payments for fixed assets (free \n\ncash flow) generated a positive cash flow of £66.0 million (2022/23: \n\n£47.6 million). Consequently, the Group’s cash conversion ratio for \n\nthe year (free cash flow divided by AOP) was 104.3% (2022/23: \n\n84.3%). Our cumulative cash conversion since we first reported as a \n\nPLC in 2020/21 stands at 109.9% over the four years, which is ahead \n\nof our sustainable cash conversion target of 100% and reflects the \n\nGroup’s longer-term performance against this measure. \n\nIf required, the Group has access to a committed revolving credit \n\nfacility (RCF) of £30 million with HSBC. The facility commenced on \n\n17 May 2023, replacing the Group’s previous facility for the same \n\namount and runs for three years, until 17 May 2026, with an optional \n\none year extension to 17 May 2027. To date, the Group has not \n\nutilised the facility. \n\nProposed dividends \n\nAs stated above, the Group’s dividend policy is to distribute 40% \n\nof post-tax pre-exceptional earnings to shareholders. Accordingly, \n\nthe Board is pleased to propose a gross final dividend of 6.0 pence \n\nper share. The aggregate amount of the proposed dividend \n\nexpected to be paid out of retained earnings at 29 February 2024, \n\nbut not recognised as a liability at the end of the financial year, \n\nis £14.4 million. In light of the company’s continued strong \n\nperformance and cash generation, the Board also considers it \n\nappropriate to propose a cash return to ordinary shareholders with \n\na special dividend of 8.7 pence per share, equating to £20.9 million. \n\nIf approved by shareholders, the final and special dividend will be \n\npayable on Friday, 2 August 2024 to all ordinary shareholders who \n\nare registered as such at the close of business on the record date \n\nof Friday, 19 July 2024. \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n29 This has been an excellent year for progress in environmental \n\n## and social goals.

In \n\n# 2023/24, for the first time, we had more than 1,000 employees, as we \n\n# continued to expand our teams to serve our growing customer base. \n\nTwo leading brands, \n\none set of values \n\nOur two businesses, Bytes and \n\nPhoenix, have 631 and 420 people \n\nrespectively. Each business operates \n\nautonomously and has its own \n\nidentity, headquarters and \n\nmanagement team, but they have \n\nmany commonalities. These include \n\nsimilar employment policies, \n\nindustry-leading knowledge and, \n\nmost importantly, the same values \n\nand culture. The businesses also look \n\nfor opportunities to share good practice \n\nand insights, for the benefit of BTG. \n\nCommunicating with \n\nour employees \n\nAlong with the regulatory announcement \n\nto the market, communicating with \n\nemployees was one of our primary \n\nconcerns after the former CEO’s \n\nresignation. New CEO, and former MD \n\nPhoenix, Sam Mudd communicated with \n\nall staff to introduce herself to those at \n\nBytes and reassure employees that Neil’s \n\nresignation would have minimal impact on \n\nthe continuity of the business. We also \n\nprepared an interview piece about Sam \n\nthat went out to all employees. Throughout \n\nthis period, Sam led by example with her \n\nhonest, open approach, which helped all \n\nmanagers and employees do the same. \n\nWe were pleased to hear that people \n\ngenerally felt that the situation was, \n\nas we characterised it, the actions \n\nof one individual and was in no way \n\na reflection on the company or the \n\nrest of the BTG team. \n\nGrowing our great team \n\nEvery year our customer base grows and \n\nthe technology powering the products we \n\nprovide evolves. To keep offering the high \n\nlevels of service and expertise for which \n\nwe are renowned, we also need to expand \n\nand adapt. That means recruiting new \n\npeople with a passion for technology, \n\nas well as training and retaining our \n\nexisting employees. \n\n## Apprenticeships are an important and successful part of our efforts to \n\n## develop our talent from within.

We \n\ncontinued to generate impressive \n\nsurvey results this year, with 94% of \n\nemployees at Phoenix and 87% at \n\nBytes agreeing that they work at a \n\n‘great place’, compared to 54% of \n\nemployees at a typical UK-based \n\ncompany. Both businesses featured \n\nin the following Best Workplaces \n\nlists this year too: women, wellbeing \n\nand tech. In addition, Phoenix \n\nwas ranked seventh in the UK’s \n\nBest Workplaces among large \n\norganisations, and Bytes moved \n\nup ten places in the same overall \n\nrankings during the year. \n\nThis year, we increased our headcount \n\nby almost 14%, to 1,057. We’re proud of \n\nthe loyalty of our people, many of whom \n\nhave been with us for a long time. We ran \n\nnew apprenticeships in HR, marketing, \n\nsustainability, governance and business \n\nanalysis in 2023/24 and, across the Group, \n\ndoubled the degree-level apprenticeships \n\nwe offer. Apprenticeships are an \n\nimportant and successful part of our \n\nefforts to develop our talent from within, \n\nand our new employees included 15 sales \n\nand technical apprentices across our two \n\nbusinesses. This year, and for the first \n\ntime within Bytes, we had four people \n\ndoing degree-level apprenticeships – \n\ngaining valuable work experience while \n\nthey study – a development that we are \n\nreally pleased with. \n\nWith many new people joining us, it \n\nwas important to make sure we had \n\nthe capacity to integrate them, to offer \n\nsupport and to help them understand \n\nour culture. Our induction programmes, \n\nwhich run over several weeks, are \n\ndesigned to get people quickly up to \n\nspeed with our way of working. All our \n\nmanagers receive training on how to \n\nonboard employees, and this year \n\nwe appointed leaders in the various \n\ndepartments to provide additional \n\nsupport. Other measures include pairing \n\nnew staff with an experienced ‘buddy’, \n\nintroductory meetings with department \n\nheads and directors, and a check-in from \n\nthe welfare manager after a few months. \n\nRewarding our people, \n\nwhatever their roles \n\nWe pay our people fairly, but we also \n\nreward high achievers and those who \n\ngo the extra mile for our customers and \n\ncolleagues. Our employee recognition \n\nprogrammes, based on the achievement \n\nof business objectives, both for sales and \n\nnon-sales staff, include prizes such as a \n\nscuba-diving trip to Malta. We also offer \n\nawards for employees of the month and \n\npeople who are seen to be ‘living our \n\nvalues’ in all they do at work. At Bytes \n\nthis year, eight people recognised for \n\nsupporting their colleagues’ wellbeing \n\nwere rewarded with a stay at a wellness \n\nspa near Lake Garda in Italy. \n\nWe also recognise and reward long \n\nservice. This year, Phoenix aligned its \n\npolicy with Bytes, to give an additional day \n\nof annual leave for anyone who has been \n\nwith us for five years, rising to an extra five \n\ndays’ paid holiday for those with 25 years \n\nof service. \n\nIn June 2023, we launched our third \n\nSharesave scheme, which was again \n\nwell received. More than half our staff \n\nhave participated in one or more of these \n\nplans. Taken together, all these initiatives \n\ncontribute to our high employee net \n\npromoter score (eNPS) of 71, which \n\nmeasures the likelihood of people \n\nrecommending their employer to others. \n\nOur values \n\n•• Be passionate about our \n\nemployees, vendors and \n\ncustomers \n\n•• Act with integrity at all times \n\n•• Work together and collaborate \n\nacross teams \n\n•• Be kind and respectful to all \n\npeople, all of the time \n\n•• Get business done and \n\nhave fun doing it \n\n> Annual Report and Accounts 2023/24\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n> 33\n\nSustainability review continued \n\nSupporting wellbeing and \n\npromoting good mental health \n\nWe do all we can to support the health and \n\nhappiness of our people. They can, for \n\nexample, use the free or subsidised gyms \n\nat or near our offices, and buy reduced-\n\nprice bicycles through our cycle-to-work \n\nprogramme. In our offices we provide \n\nfree fruit and healthy meal options. \n\nWe take mental health seriously, \n\nencouraging openness and providing \n\nsupport for anyone who needs it. We have \n\na 24/7 employee assistance programme, \n\noffer up to two extra days of discretionary \n\npaid leave for people in difficulty, and our \n\ndesignated wellness ambassadors are \n\nalways available for a chat. This year \n\nwe held informative sessions for staff \n\nabout men’s mental health, menopause \n\nand, given the high cost of living, financial \n\nwellbeing. Our managers also received \n\ntraining on mental health issues, and an \n\nintroduction to neurodiversity. \n\nOur hybrid-working policy – which, with \n\ntheir manager, lets people determine the \n\nbest approach for them and the business \n\n– contributes to wellbeing. People whose \n\nrole doesn’t require them to be fully \n\noffice-based can spend around half their \n\nhours working remotely. We believe this \n\ngives us and our people the best of both \n\nworlds: the benefits of collaboration, \n\ninnovation and social interaction in the \n\noffice, with the flexibility and positive \n\nwork-life balance that comes from \n\nbeing at home. \n\n# 282 new BTG employees this year \n\n34 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nREVIEW OF THE YEAR Helping our people fulfil \n\ntheir potential \n\nWe want all our people to reach their \n\npotential. Every employee, whatever \n\ntheir role, is given an opportunity to be \n\nsupported on a personal development \n\nplan. We provide regular opportunities \n\nfor training, which not only benefits our \n\nemployees, but also the business, since \n\nwe can offer our customers greater \n\nexpertise. In addition, public sector \n\ntender frameworks require us to have \n\ncertain accreditations, and vendors \n\npay us higher rebates if we are well \n\naccredited. At Phoenix, for example, \n\nwe focused heavily on digital training \n\nthis year, so all our staff can operate at \n\na high level using Microsoft applications. \n\nIdentifying and developing future leaders \n\nis a strong priority for us. At Bytes, we \n\nselected 12 people, most aged under 30, \n\nto participate in a programme run by an \n\nexternal consultant to help develop their \n\nleadership skills and style, and we will \n\nextend that programme in the coming year. \n\nWorking towards greater gender \n\nand ethnic diversity \n\nProviding equal opportunities to people \n\nof all genders and ethnicities is not just \n\nsomething we believe in – we see it as our \n\nresponsibility. In recent years we’ve made \n\ngood progress in gender parity. Sam Mudd \n\nis our CEO, and Clare Metcalfe the new \n\nMD Phoenix. Women now represent 34% \n\nof the combined managers at Bytes and \n\nPhoenix, and around 40% of our total \n\nworkforce. By comparison, across the \n\nUK, less than a third of people in the \n\ntechnology sector are women. 1 At a \n\nBoard level, our gender balance was \n\n50% at year end, compared with 29% \n\nat the end of 2022/23. \n\nWe’ve also seen progression in the types \n\nof roles women hold at BTG – for example, \n\nwe have more women entering technology \n\nsales positions, which are typically better \n\npaid. As part of our commitment to \n\nencourage more women to enter the \n\ntechnology sector, we work with local \n\nschools and attend events that promote \n\nwomen in IT. \n\nWe are also trying to become more \n\nethnically diverse, though progress \n\nhas been slower than with gender. \n\nOur workforce has a higher proportion of \n\npeople from a White British ethnicity than \n\nreflects UK society as a whole, but it does \n\nreflect the demographics of the locations \n\nof our head offices, in Surrey and East \n\nYorkshire. As part of our efforts to actively \n\nencourage more diverse hiring, we provided \n\ntraining this year to our hiring managers \n\non how to avoid unconscious bias when \n\nrecruiting. We also work with a specialist \n\nagency that helps companies hire people \n\nfrom minority groups. We’ve continued to \n\ncollect data on our ethnicity breakdown, \n\nbased on voluntary self-reporting from \n\nour some of our employees and, in \n\n2024/25, aim to have a self-reporting \n\nethnicity option for all employees. \n\nWe have held awareness activities to \n\npromote understanding and inclusion. \n\nOur employees created a Ramadan \n\nawareness session, for example, \n\nwith people taking on a day of \n\nRamadan fasting. \n\nBTG gender balance \n\nas at 29 February 2024 \n\nMen Women \n\n50% 50% \n\nBoard \n\n50% 50% 22\n\nExecutive Committee \n\n66% 34% \n\nManagers 2\n\n60% 40% \n\nAll colleagues \n\n18 869% 31% \n\nExecutive Committee plus direct reports 1\n\n3392 48 633 424    \n\n> 1The Executive Committee plus direct\n> reports include executive directors, our\n> managing directors and their direct reports,\n> comprising individuals for whom they have\n> direct line management responsibility,\n> excluding administrative and support roles.\n> 2Managers refers to leaders in BTG,\n> including Executive Committee and\n> senior leadership members.\n> 1womenintech.co.uk/women-in-tech-survey-2023\n\n# 1,057 BTG total headcount \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n35 Sustainability review continued \n\n# Our communities \n\n# One of the things we are most proud of about \n\n# our people is their passion for making a real \n\n# difference in the communities in which we work. \n\nVolunteering enriches our local areas, \n\naligns with our goal of supporting social \n\ncauses and builds the reputation of our \n\nbusinesses. It’s also really enjoyable \n\nand rewarding for our employees \n\nand enhances their wellbeing. \n\nIn addition, as part of BTG’s \n\ncommitment to support positive change \n\nin our environment and communities \n\nwhere we operate, we continue to make \n\nfinancial contributions in various ways to \n\ncorporate social responsibility activities. \n\nGiving our time to help others \n\nVolunteering is at the heart of our \n\ncommunity work. We give everyone one \n\nfully paid volunteering day a year to help \n\ncauses that are close to their hearts. And \n\nmany of them use this opportunity to do \n\na wide range of wonderful work. At Bytes, \n\nfor example, more than 100 people spent \n\ntime helping at an animal charity close \n\nto our office in Surrey. The Wildlife Aid \n\nFoundation, which is one of the UK’s busiest \n\nwildlife rescue and rehabilitation centres, \n\nneeded assistance in moving to a bigger \n\nsite, so over the summer our staff got their \n\nhands dirty planting trees and hedgerows \n\nand building ponds and pathways. \n\nThe work was greatly appreciated and, \n\nbesides the satisfaction of a job well \n\ndone, our employees also benefited \n\nfrom getting to know each other better. \n\nIn all, BTG employees contributed \n\nmore than 1,500 hours to supporting \n\nour local communities. \n\nWe know how much our staff like helping \n\nother people so, to make it easier to find \n\nways to do that, we partner with the \n\nonHand volunteering platform. This \n\nenables people to sign up for ‘missions’ \n\nthat take as little as an hour. Among the \n\nlocal causes supported this way in \n\n2023/24 was the Wetherby Foodbank, \n\nand two swimming clubs: East Riding \n\nLeisure Driffield and Pocklington Dolphins. \n\nPartnering with the Rio Ferdinand \n\nFoundation to promote IT to girls \n\nAt Phoenix, we’re delighted to have built a partnership with \n\nthe Rio Ferdinand Foundation, which was set up by the former \n\nprofessional footballer to create opportunities for young \n\npeople to tackle inequality, achieve their personal potential \n\nand drive social change. This year, the foundation ran a digital \n\nleadership programme for 50 high-school girls from deprived \n\nareas of Manchester. We provided a full day of career advice \n\nfrom two women in our cybersecurity team, who talked about \n\nwhat it was like being a woman in tech and what their jobs \n\nentailed, before leading some fun digital activities. \n\nA few weeks later, the same students came to our offices in \n\nSalford, where they received a tour of Media City and took \n\npart in several immersive IT activities, including learning \n\nabout sustainable cities and then putting their knowledge \n\nto the test using Minecraft, and experiencing virtual reality \n\ntechnology. In feedback, the girls said the workshops had \n\nreally inspired them, and more than three quarters of them \n\nsaid they were thinking about careers in technology. \n\nCase study \n\n# 432 hours of volunteering by Phoenix staff \n\n36 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nREVIEW OF THE YEAR 1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRaising and donating money \n\nfor good causes \n\nAs a Group, and through our people, we \n\ndonate money to charities and institutions \n\nthat can use it to help others.

In total our people raised \n\nmore than £11,000 for them, as well as \n\nother charities and causes, including Save \n\nthe Children, Macmillan Cancer Support \n\nand the Turkey–Syria earthquake appeal. \n\nFundraising activities included entering \n\nseveral teams to run the relay event at the \n\nYorkshire Marathon, Christmas jumper day, \n\nan Easter raffle, a bake-off, and golf and \n\nhorse-racing fun days. To further support \n\nour local communities, we also sponsored \n\na girls’ and a boys’ football team, and held \n\nan autumn fair, where nearby businesses \n\nwere invited to sell their wares. \n\nMany of our employees raise money \n\nin their own time, and we’re pleased to \n\nsupport their efforts. At Bytes, we match \n\nfundraising pound for pound up to £1,000 \n\nper employee per event. Bytes supports \n\nmany good causes but focused on four \n\nin particular this year: the Wildlife Aid \n\nFoundation; the Change Foundation, \n\nwhich uses sport to help marginalised \n\nyoung people; the Rainbow Trust, \n\nwhich provides emotional and practical \n\nsupport to families who have a child with \n\nlife-threatening or terminal illness; and \n\nMovember, which raises awareness \n\nof men’s physical and mental health. \n\nFor the Change Foundation, we took part \n\nin the Thames River Kayak Challenge, along \n\nwith one of our vendors, raising around \n\n£5,000, and also ran cybersecurity \n\nawareness and social media safety \n\nworkshops for young people supported by \n\nthe charity. To raise money for Movember, \n\nwe organised a charity football tournament \n\nand set up a barbershop in our office so \n\none of our employees – a former barber \n\n– could give people wet shaves. And \n\nfor the Rainbow Trust we held various \n\nfundraising activities and promoted \n\nawareness among our staff of their \n\namazing work. All four charities were \n\nsupported through a Christmas fair, where \n\nhandmade items, baked goods and other \n\ngifts were sold and proceeds of £330 split \n\nbetween the charities. We also supported \n\nthe Macmillan Coffee Morning, which was \n\nheld at Leatherhead, with the charity \n\nbenefiting from the proceeds of £565. \n\nBytes staff also took on the mighty Dragon \n\nBoat racing, supporting Playwise. \n\nBytes also made direct financial \n\ndonations to causes that our staff really \n\ncare about, including local sports clubs \n\nand schools. Because of a laptop refresh, \n\nBytes was able to donate 140 laptops \n\nto employee-nominated non-profit \n\norganisations and charities. These \n\nlaptops have supported Lifeshare, a \n\nhomeless charity in Manchester, schools \n\nand nurseries, local youth groups and a \n\nwildlife rescue charity in East Sussex. \n\nDelivering social value in areas \n\nwhere we work \n\nPhoenix does business almost entirely \n\nin the public sector, and this comes with \n\na commitment to deliver social value \n\nwhere the work is done. We take this \n\nresponsibility seriously and are pleased \n\nto be able to use our skills to make a \n\npositive impact on people’s lives around \n\nthe country. Our social value projects \n\nthis year included building a community \n\ndirectory for charities in Hull, and \n\nproviding digital skills support for \n\nrefugees who have been resettled in \n\nLancashire. We held an event for the \n\nSunderland and County Durham Royal \n\nSociety for the Blind to demonstrate how \n\ntechnology can help visually impaired \n\npeople – including Seeing AI, a Microsoft \n\napplication that uses a phone camera to \n\nidentify and then audibly describe people \n\nand objects. \n\nWe also love working with young people, \n\nand this year our education outreach \n\nprogramme involved nearly 2,000 school \n\nchildren and young adults. This included \n\nhelping young people from disadvantaged \n\nbackgrounds explore technology, using \n\nfun activities to encourage Year 8 girls to \n\ntake IT as a GCSE subject, and supporting \n\ndigital bootcamps for young people \n\naged 19 and over from minority and \n\ndisadvantaged backgrounds. \n\nCommunity activities \n\n1 Wildlife Aid Foundation \n\n2 Dragon Boat racing \n\n3 Thames River Kayak Challenge \n\n4 Christmas fair at Leatherhead \n\n# 1, 110 hours of volunteering by Bytes staff \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n37 Sustainability review continued \n\n# Our planet \n\n# We believe that everyone has a part to play in caring for \n\n# our planet. As a responsible business, we are reducing our \n\n# carbon footprint and helping our customers to do the same. \n\nAlthough we haven’t identified a material \n\nimpact to our business through the \n\nscenario analyses in our TCFD (see \n\npages 44 to 52), climate change is too \n\nimportant for us not to take action. It is \n\nour duty as a responsible business to \n\nmeasure our carbon emissions and \n\nundertake initiatives to reduce our impact. \n\nIt is also expected of us by a wide range of \n\nstakeholders, from investors, employees \n\nand customers. Our aim is to reach net \n\nzero emissions by 2040 at the latest, ten \n\nyears ahead of the UK goal of 2050. \n\nThis year, we made major progress in more \n\nfully measuring our Scope 3 emissions – the \n\nindirect emissions across our value chain. \n\nWe are now able to report on all the Scope 3 \n\ncategories relevant to our business, which \n\nmakes a considerable difference to our \n\noverall footprint. This is because we are \n\nincluding purchased goods and services \n\nin full, which make up 93% of our total \n\nemissions, while Scope 3 overall now \n\nmakes up over 99.9% of total emissions. \n\nThis comprehensive Scope 3 reporting \n\nis a significant milestone for us and the \n\nculmination of several years of work. It is \n\nhelping us to better understand the potential \n\neffects of climate change on our business \n\n– and the role we can play in collective \n\nefforts to achieve a net zero economy. \n\nOur science-based targets \n\nIn 2021/22 we announced our ambition to \n\nbe net zero by 2040, along with near-term \n\nScope 1, 2 and 3 goals to help us get there. \n\nThis year we went further, by submitting a \n\nset of targets to the Science Based Targets \n\ninitiative (SBTi), the global organisation that \n\nhelps businesses set emissions reduction \n\ntargets in line with climate science. This \n\nstep is vital to make sure we are in line with \n\nthe Paris Agreement goal of limiting the \n\nglobal temperature rise above pre-\n\nindustrial levels to 1.5°C, which would \n\nsubstantially limit the effects of climate \n\nchange. To achieve this, global \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions must halve \n\nby 2030 – and drop to net zero by 2050. \n\nAdding to our targets and revising \n\nour Scope 3 baseline year \n\nThe 50% reduction targets for Scope 1 \n\nand 2 have been maintained and \n\nadditional interim targets submitted to \n\nthe SBTi. These are a 60% reduction in \n\nScope 1 by 2030 and maintaining a 100% \n\nreduction in Scope 2 by 2028/29. These \n\nadditional targets enable us to have \n\nnear-term targets under validation by \n\nthe SBTi, while also maintaining the \n\ntargets we previously committed to. \n\nFor Scope 3, our previously stated aim \n\nwas to reduce our emissions by half by \n\n2030, but without articulating a baseline \n\nyear. For our CDP submission in July \n\n2023, we used different baseline years \n\ndepending on when each category, or \n\nsubset of a category, was first measured. \n\nWhile we’ve kept the same 2030 goal, \n\nwe decided to adjust the base year to \n\n2022/23 – the first year for which we \n\nhad data for all the relevant Scope 3 \n\ncategories. This change applies to all \n\nScope 3 categories, even those we \n\nmeasured in previous years, to give us \n\na baseline year that is consistent and \n\nrealistic. Although we had hoped to \n\nmaintain the challenging baseline year \n\nset during Covid for business travel, the \n\nchanges to UK policy on the ban on sales \n\nof new petrol and diesel cars have made \n\nachieving reductions unreasonably \n\ndifficult. The change to our baseline, \n\nhowever, has not affected our strong \n\nfocus to reduce all our Scope 3 emissions \n\nas quickly as we can. \n\nIn our original low-carbon action plan \n\nin 2021/22, we had set interim targets \n\nfor category 5 (waste), and a subset of \n\ncategory 1 (paper, water and wastewater), \n\nof a 50% reduction by 2025/26. These are \n\nnow incorporated in the overall Scope 3 \n\nreduction targets for 2030 and 2040. As \n\nour sustainability strategy matures, we’re \n\ndeveloping specific waste and water \n\npolicies, with targets based on a quantity \n\nreduction and lifecycle processes, which \n\nwe hope to publish next financial year. We \n\nbelieve this is a more robust way to target \n\nefficient resource use. Having removed \n\nwater and waste as separate targets, \n\nleaving paper, we will continue to monitor \n\npaper usage and make more reductions \n\nwhere possible. But, given paper alone \n\nis a tiny fraction* of our emissions, its \n\nimpact on our footprint is minimal and \n\nnot deemed to warrant a separate \n\ncarbon reduction target. \n\nOur targets \n\nBy 2025/26 (from \n\n2020/21 baseline) \n\nBy 2028/29 (from \n\n2020/21 baseline) \n\nBy 2030/31 (from \n\n2022/23 baseline 2)\n\nBy 2040/41 \n\nReduce Scope 1 \n\nemissions by \n\n# 50% \n\nReduce Scope 2 \n\nemissions by 1\n\n# 50% \n\nMaintain a \n\nreduction \n\nof Scope 2 \n\nemissions by \n\n# 100% \n\nReduce Scope 1 \n\nemissions by \n\n# 60% \n\nReduce Scope 3 \n\nemissions by \n\n# 50% \n\nReach \n\n# net \n\n# zero emissions across \n\nthe value chain    \n\n> 1We achieved our Scope 2 target in 2021/22 by completing a Group-wide switch to renewable energy\n> for all our electricity at our owned offices.\n> 22022/23 baseline applies only to Scope 3 target.

Lisa \n\nworks with the senior leadership team, our \n\nSustainability Steering Committee and \n\nthe wider business to coordinate our \n\nactivities, ensure progress against our \n\ntargets and report performance. The role \n\nrequires staying up to date on corporate \n\nand public sector expectations, and \n\nworking with our customers and suppliers \n\nto make sure we are putting resources \n\nwhere we can have the biggest impact. \n\nFor full details of how we oversee and \n\nmanage environmental issues, see our \n\nTCFD report on pages 44 to 52. \n\nHow we contribute to the environment \n\nWe’re a value-added IT reseller, focusing on cloud and security software \n\ndeveloped by leading vendors, so don’t manufacture or transport physical goods. \n\nWhile we have two big offices, many of our people work part of the week from \n\nhome under our hybrid-working policy. This means that our direct impact on the \n\nenvironment is quite small, and mostly relates to carbon emissions. \n\nIt also means that the positive effect we can have through our direct emissions is \n\nlimited, because what we do ourselves will only have a relatively small effect on \n\noverall greenhouse gas emissions. However, we must all play our role, because \n\nif everybody does what’s within their power, the overall impact will be significant. \n\nAs our expanded Scope 3 reporting shows, value-chain emissions are key to our \n\ncommitment to get to net zero. This means we need to work with our suppliers to \n\nunderstand their emissions and carbon reduction plans, so we can prioritise \n\nlow-carbon technologies and vendors that demonstrate the same commitment \n\nas ourselves. And although our own emissions that relate to our customers are \n\nminimal, we can make a positive contribution to a net zero future by supporting \n\nthem to make more sustainable IT decisions. \n\nThe importance of collective action is reflected in the increasing expectations \n\nfrom all stakeholders, including regulators, that businesses take responsibility \n\nfor minimising their own emissions. Under UK regulations, companies will soon \n\nbe required to report on their net zero transition plans, alongside the existing \n\nrequirement to report against the recommendations of TCFD (see pages 44 to 52). \n\nThe road to 2040 – our journey so far \n\n> ISO 14001\n> environmental\n> management\n> system attained\n> Initial measurement\n> of our carbon footprint\n> Reported Scope 1, 2\n> and 3 (business travel)\n> emissions under\n> SECR guidelines\n\n2020/21 \n\n> Launched low-\n> carbon action plan\n> Completed move\n> to 100% renewable\n> electricity\n> Achieved carbon\n> neutral operational\n> emissions\n> through offsetting\n> Announced net zero\n> by 2040 goal\n\n2021/22  \n\n> Partnered with\n> aspecialist consultancy\n> to help analyse\n> Scope 3 emissions\n> Expanded our Scope\n> 3 reporting from two\n> to six categories\n> Moved to 100%\n> green gas in our\n> Phoenix operations\n> Exceeded Scope 2\n> emissions target\n> Made first\n> submission to CDP\n> (formerly Carbon\n> Disclosure Project)\n\n2022/23 \n\n> Appointed first\n> Group sustainability\n> manager\n> Submitted carbon\n> reduction targets to\n> the SBTi\n> Achieved our first\n> CDP score\n> Expanded\n> measurement of\n> Scope 3 categories,\n> with all relevant\n> categories now fully\n> reported\n> Maintained 100%\n> renewable energy for\n> our owned offices\n\n2023/24 \n\n> Validation of our\n> targets by the SBTi\n> (anticipated)\n> Developing\n> transition plans\n> to achieve our\n> near-term and\n> net zero\n> emissions targets\n> Continued focus on\n> reducing emissions\n> related to employee\n> commuting and\n> business travel\n> Development of\n> a carbon literacy\n> and sustainability\n> education\n> programme\n\n2024/25 \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n39 Sustainability review continued \n\n# Taking responsibility for our environmental \n\n# footprint across the value chain \n\nSince the start of the 2022/23 year, we’ve \n\nworked in partnership with a specialist \n\ncarbon emissions consultancy to get a \n\ngreater understanding of our Scope 3 \n\nemissions, and so broaden our reporting \n\nof the categories that apply to us (as \n\ndefined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, \n\nwhich is used as the methodology for all \n\nour carbon reporting – see the appendix \n\non page 195 ). Having comprehensive \n\ndata has enabled us to become far more \n\nsophisticated in our analyses and reporting. \n\nWe have identified that ten of the 15 Scope 3 \n\nreporting categories are relevant to our \n\nbusiness. This is a change from our \n\nexpected nine categories last financial \n\nyear, because we have moved our \n\nleased offices emissions into category 8, \n\nupstream leased assets. This was done \n\nbecause they are not required to be \n\nreported in Scope 2 under our use of \n\nfinancial control as our organisational \n\nboundary. In 2020/21, we reported on only \n\none category: category 6, business travel, \n\nand only to the extent that it related to cars. \n\nBy the end of 2022/23, we had measured \n\nfive categories in full and one partially – a \n\nvery small subset of category 1, purchased \n\ngoods and services. These emissions \n\nwere disclosed in our 2022/23 Annual \n\nReport, in our report to the CDP and in \n\nour individual operating company reports. \n\nThis year, we expanded our emissions \n\ndata collection to cover in full all ten \n\ncategories that are relevant to us, with \n\neffect from the 2022/23 year – having \n\ncontinued our journey from the mandatory \n\nSECR emissions reporting in 2020/21, \n\nto adding more categories as required by \n\nPPN06/21, to being able to fully report on \n\nall emissions in our third year of carbon \n\nreporting. We have been able to obtain \n\ndata for and include four categories we \n\nhad not previously reported on: capital \n\ngoods, upstream leased assets, use of \n\nsold products and end-of-life treatment of \n\nsold products. Most significantly, we fully \n\nreported for the first time on purchased \n\ngoods and services, which meant including \n\nall the emissions from our vendors that \n\nrelate to the solutions and services we \n\nprovide. As a result of this additional \n\nmeasurement, we have expanded the \n\nreporting of the emissions for 2022/23 \n\nthat were published in last year’s Annual \n\nReport, which we set out in the charts on \n\nthese pages. \n\nThis additional data measurement means \n\nthat Scope 3 emissions now account for \n\n99.9% of our total emissions for 2022/23, \n\nup from 93.5% previously (before all \n\ncategories were reported). The change \n\nis mostly due to purchased goods and \n\nservices, which constituted 93% of our \n\ntotal emissions in 2022/23. For context, \n\nbefore completing our comprehensive \n\nreporting this year, our biggest Scope 3 \n\ncategory was employee commuting, \n\naccounting for 67% of Scope 3 emissions. \n\nThis is now 1% of total Scope 3 emissions, \n\nas shown in the charts.     \n\n> Restatements to our Scope 1, 2, and 3 reporting\n> for the 2022/23 financial year\n> ••Scope 1 and 2 have been amended to remove\n> assumptions related to leased offices, because we\n> don’t have financial control.

However, this \n\nis accounted for by the much broader \n\nreporting of our Scope 3 emissions this \n\nyear, in particular the inclusion for the \n\nfirst time of purchased goods and \n\nservices, as discussed above. \n\nThis year, we have been able to collate \n\nand measure emissions more accurately, \n\nwith an improvement to the methodology \n\nfor our expanded and recalculated \n\n2022/23 emissions, with 2023/24 \n\nfollowing the same methodologies. It \n\nhas been a significant piece of work, but \n\none which will ensure we have the most \n\nreliable baseline to compare future Scope 3 \n\nemissions. Our emissions increased in \n\n2023/24, largely due to higher vendor \n\nspend and revenue. Our actions for this \n\nnext year will be to create a transition plan \n\nfor our route to net zero, which will include \n\nworking with our vendors to understand \n\ntheir journeys and commitments to \n\nreduce emissions. Although our largest \n\nemissions are those not in our direct \n\ncontrol, we will also focus on actions that \n\nwe can take to influence a reduction in \n\nother areas. \n\nIn 2022/23, we reduced our market-based \n\nScope 2 emissions to zero by moving to \n\nrenewable electricity. We were able to \n\nmaintain that this year through purchasing \n\nrenewable energy for our owned offices. In \n\n2023/24, our Scope 1 emissions reduced \n\ndue to a move to green gas in York and \n\nhaving overcome the air-conditioning \n\nmaintenance issues that increased our \n\nemissions in the prior year. We continue \n\nto embed sustainability in our decision \n\nmaking, which contributed to choosing \n\nour shared office space in London, which \n\nwe moved into in March 2023. This office \n\nis run by a certified B Corp company \n\nand uses 100% renewable energy. \n\nGovernment action on policy and \n\ninfrastructure is crucial to enable the \n\nuniversal adoption of electric vehicles. \n\nThis year the UK Government announced \n\na five-year delay to the proposed ban on \n\nnew petrol and diesel cars, from 2030 to \n\n2035. However, we are continuing to play \n\nour role, through a scheme that allows \n\nemployees to buy electric vehicles via \n\nsalary sacrifice. It has proved more \n\nsuccessful than we expected, with 29 \n\npeople entering the scheme since we \n\nrolled it out in 2023/24. We will continue to \n\npromote the scheme in the coming year. \n\nThis year we expanded our approach to \n\ntaking responsibility for emissions. The \n\nvalue of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions has \n\nbeen covered by investing in a carbon \n\nremoval mangrove restoration project \n\nin Pakistan. This not only supports \n\ncarbon sequestration but also provides \n\nbiodiversity net gain and community \n\nbenefits through reducing erosion \n\nand supporting fish nurseries. \n\nWe’ve offset our business emissions under \n\nScope 3 (categories 2 to 8, inclusive). \n\nThe carbon removal and offsetting are \n\npurchased through our partner Ecologi, \n\nwhich supports Gold Standard and \n\nVerra-approved carbon reduction, and \n\ncommunity- and biodiversity-enhancing \n\nprojects around the world. This year we are \n\nbacking projects in Morocco, Pakistan and \n\nPeru, among others. Over the long term, \n\nhowever, we are committed to reduction \n\nrather than offsetting. \n\nEnergy and carbon data* \n\nShowing expanded Scope 3 from prior year 2022/23 \n\nEnergy and carbon emissions (kWh and tCO 2e) 2023/24 2022/23 (restated**)      \n\n> Group kWh tCO 2ekWh tCO 2eChange\n\nEnergy consumption 4,989,909 4,186,753 +803,156 kWh \n\nScope 1 – Direct emissions from our sites 152,163 45.5 166,558 73.2 -27.7 \n\nScope 2 – Indirect emissions from the energy we buy \n\nLocation-based 1\n\n1,000,124 207.1 823,998 161.2 +45.9 \n\nMarket-based 2 0.0 0.0 0\n\nScope 3 – All other indirect emissions across \n\nour value chain \n\n3,837,622 151,777.2 3,196,197 113,793.7 +37,983.4 \n\nTotal emissions – location-based 1 152,029.8 114,028.1 +38.001.6 \n\nRelative emissions – location-based tCO 2e/£m 83.4 79.2 +4.2 \n\nTaking our renewable energy into account \n\nTotal emissions – market-based 2 151,822.7 113,867.0 +37,955.6 \n\nRelative emissions – market-based tCO 2e/£m 83.3 79.1 +4.2      \n\n> *Our methodologies for reporting energy and carbon data are set out in the appendix on page 195 .\n> ** 2022/23 emissions figures are restated for Scope 1, 2 and 3, categories 5 and 8.

In \n\nparticular, we do this by supporting them \n\nin moving their on-site servers, products \n\nand services to the cloud, which has the \n\npotential to be more energy efficient than \n\ncustomers hosting data centres themselves. \n\nWe can also support in an advisory \n\ncapacity, so customers are able to add \n\nsustainability into their decision making. \n\nWe support customers to become more \n\nsustainable by enabling them to hold \n\nonline meetings, which reduces travel \n\nemissions, and through solutions such as \n\nPhoenix’s sustainability app. The app – \n\ndeveloped with Microsoft and winner of \n\nSustainable Solution/Service of the Year \n\n2022 at the CRN Tech Impact Awards \n\n– connects to energy, water and mileage \n\ndata, allowing organisations to start \n\nmeasuring and understanding their \n\nemissions. However, we are also mindful \n\nof the environmental impact of new \n\ntechnologies such as AI-enabled tools, \n\nwhich require additional computing power \n\nand cloud storage, which consume a lot \n\nof energy. We will continue to monitor this \n\nin the coming year. \n\n# Looking ahead \n\nWe are clear on what we aim to achieve in \n\nthe coming year. Once the SBTi validates \n\nour carbon reduction targets, we will \n\ndevelop our net zero transition plan to \n\nhelp us achieve them, and this will build \n\non the low-carbon action plans we have \n\nused so far. This will include working even \n\nmore closely with our top-tier vendors, \n\nwhich account for more than 80% of our \n\nScope 3 emissions, to gain a greater \n\nunderstanding of their net zero plans. \n\nWe take confidence from the fact that \n\nmany of them have well-publicised and \n\nambitious carbon reduction programmes. \n\nOur biggest partner, Microsoft, for \n\nexample, has an ambitious plan to be \n\n‘carbon negative’ by 2030; this includes \n\nreducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions to \n\nnear zero in 2025, and cutting Scope 3 \n\nemissions in half by 2030. And, of course, \n\nwe will strive to keep reducing our own \n\nemissions, as a business and through the \n\nactions we take as individuals, to help \n\nprotect the planet for future generations. \n\nEntrenching sustainability in our culture \n\nReducing emissions is an ongoing reality that must be lived in the \n\nchoices we make every day. Across both our businesses, we focus \n\non helping our people make sustainable choices, including: \n\n•• Reducing our business travel by encouraging our people to contact \n\ncustomers and vendors by phone or videoconference whenever possible \n\n•• Supporting hybrid working and efficient working practices to \n\nreduce commuting \n\n•• Encouraging our people to commute in a more efficient way by \n\ninstalling electric car charging points at our main locations, setting \n\nup a car sharing network and installing secure cycle parking \n\n•• Partnering with Octopus Energy to allow our people to buy electric \n\nvehicles under a salary sacrifice scheme \n\n•• Using materials, energy and water efficiently – for example, \n\nthrough PIR sensors, reduced printing, a request system \n\nfor consumables and low-flow bathroom fittings \n\n•• Continuing to highlight the importance of good environmental \n\nmanagement throughout BTG, including controlling office heating \n\nand cooling in a smart manner \n\n•• Working with suppliers and partners to reduce their carbon footprints \n\n•• Developing a carbon literacy programme for our employees, \n\nto raise understanding of environmental issues. \n\n# 100 %renewable electricity and green gas in owned offices \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n43 Task Force on Climate-related \n\n# Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \n\n# As we discussed in Our planet on pages 38 to 43 ,\n\n# we are a responsible business that is committed to \n\n# protecting the environment by reducing our carbon \n\n# emissions and helping our customers to do the same. \n\nWe are acutely aware of the impact climate \n\nchange could have on our business and \n\nsociety, and the risks it brings to businesses \n\nand their supply chains. We support the \n\nbroader adoption of TCFD reporting, \n\nbecause we believe that it will accelerate \n\nbusiness efforts towards the net zero \n\nfuture we all need to achieve. \n\nClimate change is one of the biggest \n\nchallenges facing the world today, and \n\nthe UK Government has made it a priority \n\nfor all businesses by its focus on climate \n\npolicy and regulation. This includes the \n\nupcoming requirement to publish net zero \n\ntransition plans in support of the UK’s \n\noverall net zero target. \n\nWe have made some changes to our \n\nTCFD this year to factor in the Companies \n\n(Strategic Report) (Climate-related \n\nFinancial Disclosure) Regulations 2022 \n\n(Regulations), new UK regulations that \n\naffect our reporting requirements for \n\n2023/24 and our continued efforts to \n\ncomply with TCFD recommendations.

This is \n\nbecause, unlike many companies in \n\nother sectors, we do not have factories or \n\noperations outside the UK and, at present, \n\nwe perceive the impact of extreme weather \n\nevents in the UK to be relatively low. We do \n\nnot require staff and customers to always \n\nattend our offices in person, and the \n\nhardware we sell, which is transported by \n\nthird parties, represents a relatively small \n\npart of our business. Like all responsible \n\ncompanies, we will continue playing our \n\npart by reducing our environmental \n\nimpacts. But it’s possible that climate \n\nchange may bring some opportunities \n\nfor us, as companies look to technology \n\nto help them with the systems and services \n\nneeded to manage and monitor its impacts. \n\nNonetheless, the world’s understanding \n\nof climate change and its effects are \n\nconstantly evolving, and we need to \n\nmonitor this on an ongoing basis to make \n\nsure we can continue to withstand its \n\nimpacts and support the transition to \n\na low-carbon economy. \n\nCompliance with TCFD \n\nThis is our third report against the \n\nrecommendations of TCFD, which \n\nhas been expanded to incorporate the \n\nrequirements of the Regulations, which \n\nalso aligns with the recommendations of \n\nTCFD. This year, we have complied with \n\nall 11 areas of TCFD and, in comments \n\nin the table that follows, explained \n\nwhere we were previously only partially \n\ncompliant.

This is outlined within \n\nour Sustainability Framework, which \n\nincludes our sustainability reporting \n\nmethodology – which is available at \n\nbytesplc.com/sustainability . Relevant \n\nperformance information is reported to the \n\nBoard on a half-yearly basis, which includes \n\nprogress against targets, significant actions \n\ntaken and any changes to risk, with any \n\nmaterial matters discussed and actions \n\nidentified, as necessary. \n\nIn addition, sustainability strategies may \n\nalso be discussed at the annual budget \n\nmeeting to review any material projects \n\nwith capital expenditure, such as on-site \n\nrenewable energy generation projects \n\nand appointment of a Group sustainability \n\nmanager. As part of our enterprise risk \n\nmanagement framework, our principal and \n\nemerging Group risks, and any changes to \n\nthese, are also presented to the Board \n\ntwice a year for approval. \n\n# Strategy \n\nOur strategy is to grow organically by doing \n\nmore with existing customers and winning \n\nnew ones. But we also want to grow while \n\nminimising our impact on the environment, \n\nwhich is why our commitment to achieving \n\nnet zero by 2040 matters, since it enshrines \n\nthat aim in our strategic plans. Depending \n\non how the effects of climate change \n\nmaterialise, there could also be \n\nopportunities for us as more customers \n\nlook to technology to mitigate its effects. \n\nThe Board is supported by our CEO, CFO \n\nand other senior leaders in ensuring that \n\nsustainability remains core to our strategy. \n\nIt was again covered at our 2023/24 Board \n\nstrategy session, and remains part of \n\ntwice-yearly sustainability updates to the \n\nBoard. During the year, the Board was \n\nbriefed on the progress of our sustainability \n\ninitiatives and our TCFD report, along with \n\nreceiving standing updates on emerging \n\nexternal trends and developments, and \n\nstakeholder expectations around \n\ncommitments to net zero. \n\nBeyond the Board, we have a tiered chain \n\nof responsibility within the business for \n\ndriving, embedding and monitoring \n\nour approach to environmental issues, \n\nincluding consideration of the potential \n\neffects of climate change. \n\nOur Executive Committee is responsible \n\nfor the delivery of our environmental \n\ntargets, and reviews and monitors climate \n\nrisks and opportunities, reporting to the \n\nBoard. Our CFO is the executive director \n\nresponsible for overseeing climate \n\nchange-related activities and, working \n\nwith our Group sustainability manager \n\nand the MDs of our operations, leads \n\nthe development of our climate change \n\npolicies. Our CFO is also responsible \n\nfor overseeing climate-related financial \n\nactivities and reporting, including \n\nsponsoring the Sustainability Steering \n\nCommittee, as well as the Group risk \n\nforum. The forum is made up of senior \n\ncolleagues from across our governance \n\nand sustainability, risk management and \n\nfinance functions. The Group risk updates \n\nare presented for review by the Board and \n\nExecutive and Audit Committees in line \n\nwith our risk review cycle. \n\nAnalysing our climate-related \n\nrisks and opportunities \n\nIn 2023/24, we reassessed the climate-\n\nrelated risks and opportunities that we \n\nidentified last year, alongside TCFD \n\nrecommendations, and conducted \n\nscenario and financial analyses and \n\nfinancial risk assessment. \n\nScenario methodology \n\nTo incorporate the most realistic changes \n\nin temperature for the UK, where the \n\nGroup’s operations are located, we have \n\nselected three scenarios: two scenarios \n\nbelow 2°C of global warming above \n\npre-industrial levels and one scenario of \n\n3°C. Our analyses covered physical risks \n\n(acute and chronic threats relating to \n\nextreme weather) and transition risks \n\n(such as financial, political, social and \n\nreputational factors), which could have a \n\nnegative impact on our business, supply \n\nchain and employees. \n\nAt operational level, we have our \n\nSustainability Steering Committee, which \n\naims to meet quarterly, and at least twice \n\na year. It monitors the impact of climate \n\nchange through discussions and ensures \n\nwe integrate environmental issues into our \n\nstrategic planning. The Group sustainability \n\nmanager keeps up to date with the latest \n\nscience and regulations and works with \n\nother members of the committee to interpret \n\nthe potential risks across the business. As \n\nwell as the Group sustainability manager, \n\nthe committee includes our CFO and other \n\nsenior leadership members and colleagues \n\nwith relevant functional roles or who have \n\na particular interest in this area. Our CFO \n\nreports on the progress of our environmental \n\ninitiatives and our risks and opportunities, \n\nas covered by the Sustainability Steering \n\nCommittee, to the Executive Committee. \n\nAlso at operational level, we have two \n\nstaff-led teams, one for each of our \n\nbusinesses, which promote initiatives, \n\nraise awareness of the importance of \n\nenvironmental issues and carry out local \n\nactivity: the Better Bytes group and the \n\nPhoenix Sustainability Network. These \n\nteams form an integral part of our \n\ncollective efforts and report into our \n\nSustainability Steering Committee. \n\nGiven the difference in physical and \n\ntransition risks, two different mechanisms \n\nhave been used for the scenarios. For \n\nphysical risk scenarios, we have selected \n\nthree relevant categories from the eight \n\nidentified in the Intergovernmental Panel \n\non Climate Change (IPCC) AR6 Categories \n\nfrom Working Group III (IPCC AR6 WGIII). \n\nThese eight categories range from C1 \n\n‘limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or \n\nlimited overshoot’ up to C8 ‘exceed \n\nwarming of 4°C (>50%)’. BTG has chosen \n\nto use C1, C3 and C6, as detailed in \n\nthe physical risk scenarios table. For \n\ntransition risks, we have chosen to use \n\nthe International Energy Agency (IEA) \n\nWorld Energy Outlook 2023 scenarios, \n\nwhich relate to global policy decisions \n\nand the adherence to these. These \n\nrange across three different trajectories, \n\nas detailed in the transition risk \n\nscenarios table. \n\n46 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nTCFD We considered these risk scenarios \n\nover a broad timeframe, from 2023/24: \n\n•• Short term: one to three years – the \n\ndepreciation of the majority of our IT \n\nassets, which reflects the length of our \n\ntypical customer software contracts \n\n•• Medium term: three to ten years – to \n\n2030, the target date for our main \n\nemissions goal \n\n•• Long term: ten to 26 years – which \n\ncovers our net zero goal of 2040, \n\nand the start of 2050, the UK’s net \n\nzero target. \n\nSome risks may arise in the shorter term; \n\nhowever many of the effects of climate \n\nchange will arise in the longer term and \n\ntherefore come with an inherent level of \n\nuncertainty. We have identified those – and \n\npotential opportunities – most likely to \n\naffect BTG, as set out in the tables on \n\npages 48 to 51.

We have confidence \n\nthat the business would be resilient \n\nagainst the physical risks of climate \n\nchange under the scenarios assessed. \n\nNonetheless, we will continue to monitor \n\nthe potential impact of increases in global \n\ntemperatures and will adapt our analyses \n\nas necessary. \n\nOverall, our analyses showed no \n\nimmediate material risks that would affect \n\nour strategy or performance, and so \n\nconcluded that climate change remains \n\nan emerging risk for BTG. However, as \n\nthe analyses demonstrate, the transition \n\nrisk that suggests a moderate financial \n\nimpact is about staying aligned with \n\nstakeholders’ expectations and regulation \n\nrelating to climate change. In 2022/23, \n\nwe elevated the regulatory aspects of \n\nsustainability to a principal risk. This \n\nprincipal risk incorporates all aspects \n\nof sustainability and, in particular, relates \n\nto predicted and unforeseen future \n\nregulations, which may assess areas that \n\nwe haven’t measured with the same focus \n\nas climate, such as biodiversity and social \n\naspects of sustainability. The risk from \n\nclimate remains as an emerging risk \n\n(see our risk report for more details on \n\npages 53 to 62). \n\n> Annual Report and Accounts 2023/24\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n> 47\n\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) continued \n\nTo analyse the materiality of the risks, \n\nwe used the same process and financial \n\nimpact categories to categorise the \n\nclimate risks as we do for principal risks. \n\nAn assessment has been made on the \n\npotential financial cost/benefit for each \n\nof those identified and this dictates \n\nthe relevant materiality of each risk/ \n\nopportunity. The materiality of the risks \n\nthen informs whether the business needs \n\nto take into account the risk/opportunity \n\nin strategic or financial planning. At \n\npresent, the materiality of the risks and \n\nopportunities to the business is considered \n\nlow and our resilience to risks high. The \n\nfollowing table shows these categories, \n\nwhich are also referenced in the risks \n\nand opportunities tables. \n\n> Short term: one to three years\n> Medium term: three to ten years\n> Long term: ten to 26 years\n\nFocusing on Scope 3 \n\nopportunities \n\nDevelopments this year have not changed \n\nour initial conclusions around the nature of \n\nclimate change in itself as an emerging risk \n\nfor BTG, as described above. We are \n\ntherefore confident that it has had a limited \n\neffect on our accounting judgements and \n\nestimates this year, and have determined \n\nthat it has had no material impact on \n\nour asset and liability valuations at \n\n29 February 2024. \n\nHowever, like other companies, we \n\nneed to focus on our own impact on \n\nthe environment through our emissions. \n\nWe know that helping our customers \n\nreduce their emissions through \n\ntechnology is an opportunity for us, \n\nalthough this is still relatively difficult to \n\nmeasure. So, while keeping a watching \n\nbrief on climate science and related \n\npolicy, we’ve been working with an \n\nexternal partner to analyse our Scope 3 \n\nemissions more fully. For the first time, \n\nwe were able to report on all the Scope 3 \n\ncategories relevant to our business, \n\nwhich made a considerable difference \n\nto our overall footprint. Completing this \n\nwork was an important milestone and \n\nhas enabled us to better understand the \n\npotential effects of climate change on \n\nour business, and to set meaningful \n\ntargets for reduction. We submitted \n\nour near-term and net zero targets to \n\nthe Science Based Targets initiative \n\n(SBTi) for validation this year. \n\nThe data we collected is also helping us \n\nexplore ways we can reduce emissions in \n\npartnership with our vendors and customers, \n\nand to determine whether we need to factor \n\nclimate issues into our future financial \n\nplanning.

Failure to \n\ncomply with this risk, which is \n\nrelatively low, could result in \n\ndamage to our reputation and \n\npossible regulatory fines in \n\ncertain instances. \n\nWe have several internal groups \n\nin place to manage sustainability, \n\nincluding the effects of climate \n\nchange on our business.

This could further \n\nencourage employees to \n\nwork from home or at other \n\nless formal locations. \n\nMarket These changes could mean that \n\ncustomers no longer needed so \n\nmuch of the hardware infrastructure \n\nthat we supply, such as desktop \n\ncomputers and telephones. \n\nHowever, hardware makes up less \n\nthan 5% of our business, and the \n\nsoftware side is unlikely to be \n\naffected. So, the impact on us \n\nwould be relatively small and \n\npotentially feeds into some of the \n\nopportunities identified around \n\nincreased cloud computing. \n\nGiven this risk is relatively \n\ninsignificant, and within BTG’s risk \n\ntolerance, we have not developed \n\nformal mitigation plans. \n\nNZE – minor \n\nAPS – minor \n\nSTEPS – minor \n\nSubstitution of existing \n\nproducts and services \n\nthat we currently sell, \n\nwith new technologies \n\nthat are not in our \n\nportfolio \n\nTechnology On balance, we believe that most \n\nof the software we sell would not \n\nbe affected by this situation, \n\nwhich presents both risks and \n\nopportunities to BTG. If our \n\ncustomers moved away from our \n\nexisting products and services, \n\nand we did not have relationships \n\nwith vendors that sold the new \n\nin-demand products and services, \n\nwe would lose sales. However, if we \n\nhad built those relationships and \n\ncould offer those new products and \n\nservices, we would benefit from \n\nadditional revenue opportunities. \n\nWe analyse market trends to keep \n\nup with changes in technology and \n\ncustomer preferences and draw \n\non assistance and guidance from \n\nexternal advisors as required. \n\nWe also have internal groups that \n\nfocus on managing sustainability, \n\nincluding the effects of climate \n\nchange on our business. \n\nNZE – minor \n\nAPS – minor \n\nSTEPS – minor \n\nConcerned or negative \n\nperceptions from \n\nstakeholders that we \n\nhave not responded \n\nappropriately to \n\nclimate change \n\nReputation Damage to our reputation could \n\naffect all our stakeholders. \n\nInvestors increasingly have a \n\nsustainability mandate – so a poor \n\nor damaged reputation could \n\nnegatively affect our investment \n\ncase. Customers often include \n\na sustainability score when \n\ncomparing suppliers. Reputational \n\ndamage would lower our score, \n\nwhich, over time, would have a \n\nnegative impact on our revenue. \n\nOur suppliers could also exert \n\npressure on us if our reputation \n\nwas tarnished. Any damage to our \n\nreputation could also affect our \n\nability to attract and retain skilled \n\nstaff, who now look to employers for \n\nmore than just financial reward and \n\nadvancement opportunities. \n\nWe monitor our external reputation \n\nthrough regular dialogue with our PR \n\nagency and external advisors and \n\nengagement with our institutional \n\ninvestors, our vendors’ perception \n\nthrough periodic reviews, our \n\ncustomers’ views through our \n\ncustomer net promoter score (NPS), \n\nand our people’s views through our \n\nemployee NPS and through briefings \n\nfrom our non-executive director \n\nwith responsibility for employee \n\nengagement.

Periods of \n\nextreme heat could affect productivity \n\nand increase emissions from \n\noffices through increased use of air \n\nconditioning. Prolonged heatwaves \n\nare still expected to be limited in the \n\nUK under 2°C or lower scenarios, \n\nwith a relatively small impact to the \n\nbusiness and energy use. \n\nIncreased extreme weather could \n\naffect power lines. With the ability to \n\nwork remotely and with employees \n\ndistributed across the UK, as well as \n\nresilient cloud-based systems, the \n\nimpact to business activities and \n\nproductivity is considered limited. \n\nIf extreme weather events affect \n\npower lines, or flooding affects \n\ntravel to offices, mobile \n\nconnectivity and our network \n\naccess means that our staff could \n\nwork remotely during times of \n\npower interruption. Most of our IT \n\nrequirements are hosted in the \n\ncloud, so we have limited physical \n\nconnectivity to any one site. We \n\nhave alternative power supply \n\ncapabilities and multiple vendors \n\ncan provide additional data \n\nconnectivity, to serve locations \n\nwith on-site computing needs. \n\nIn a hotter climate and with more \n\nfrequent heatwaves, the office \n\nenvironment would need to \n\nmaintain comfortable working \n\nconditions for employees, which \n\nis currently serviced through \n\nthe HVAC system. To manage \n\nemissions, we would look to \n\nuse the most efficient and least \n\npolluting refrigerant gases and \n\nexplore alternative options to \n\nensure a comfortable working \n\nenvironment, while also maintaining \n\ncarbon efficiency. This may include \n\nthe addition of solar panels, to \n\nprovide self-generated power in \n\nmore extreme scenarios, and the \n\nUK may look to amend working \n\nhours to a working pattern similar \n\nto more southerly European \n\ncountries today. \n\nLow (C1) – minor \n\nMedium (C3) \n\n– minor \n\nHigh (C6) \n\n– moderate \n\nSupply chain disruption \n\nfrom the physical impacts \n\nof climate change \n\nGlobal supply chains could be \n\naffected by the locations of our \n\nsuppliers in more severely affected \n\nparts of the globe and through \n\ndisruptions to distribution channels. \n\nIssues are most likely to affect the \n\nrelatively small hardware and IT \n\nservices parts of BTG. Software, \n\nwhich makes up more than 94% \n\nof our gross invoiced income, is \n\nunlikely to be affected, but we \n\nwill work with our suppliers to \n\nunderstand their climate change-\n\nrelated risks.

We already \n\nactively promote the sustainability benefits of moving \n\nto the cloud, along with our expertise in this. \n\nUnder the more progressive scenarios, such as NZE, \n\nour opportunity would be greater than under the slower \n\nmechanisms – but there are several reasons for shifting \n\nto the cloud, so this may continue increasing irrespective \n\nof global climate policies. \n\nNZE – minor \n\nAPS – minor \n\nSTEPS – minor \n\nDemand for \n\nresource \n\nand energy \n\nefficiency \n\nThe growing demand for more \n\nenergy efficiency, and for lower \n\nconsumption of water and \n\nmaterials, presents opportunities \n\nfor us, because customers are \n\nlikely to need new technology to \n\nhelp them identify, monitor and \n\nmanage risk and regulatory \n\ncompliance of such climate-\n\nrelated matters. \n\nFactors linked to the drive for \n\nlow-carbon energy – such \n\nas policy incentives, new \n\ntechnologies, participation in \n\nthe carbon market and localised \n\nenergy generation – could present \n\nmore opportunities for us. \n\nGiven BTG’s established relationships with leading \n\nvendors and our understanding of their software \n\nofferings, we are well positioned to provide \n\nappropriate solutions, as and when demand \n\nincreases. This could enhance our product \n\nportfolios leading to additional revenues. \n\nUnder the more progressive scenarios, customers \n\nmight be more likely to request information about \n\nproduct sustainability, which could open up \n\nopportunities for other services. \n\nNZE – moderate \n\nAPS – moderate \n\nSTEPS – minor \n\nDemand for \n\nsustainable \n\nhardware \n\nCustomers pursuing \n\nrenewable energy programmes, \n\nenergy-efficiency measures \n\nand resource replacements or \n\ndiversification may need new, \n\nmore sustainable hardware as \n\nwell as associated software. \n\nAlthough hardware sales are not our primary revenue \n\nstream, we can advise customers on the most \n\nenvironmentally friendly models, so this could \n\npositively affect our revenue streams. We can also \n\nsupport customers in advising on models that meet \n\ncertain certifications such as TCO, ePEAT or EnergyStar. \n\nAs with the ‘demand for resource and energy \n\nefficiency’ opportunity, under more progressive \n\nscenarios customers might be more likely to request \n\ninformation about hardware sustainability, and this \n\ncould open up opportunities for other services. \n\nNZE – minor \n\nAPS – minor \n\nSTEPS – minor \n\nKeeping up with \n\nsocial change \n\nCompanies with a market-leading \n\nresponse to climate change could \n\nattract new suppliers, customers, \n\ninvestors, markets and assets. \n\nSome public sector frameworks \n\nalready rate suppliers on their \n\nsustainability credentials. \n\nBeing known for our sustainability \n\ncredentials could help us to \n\nattract and retain talent. The \n\nIT jobs market is extremely \n\ncompetitive and increasing \n\nour headcount is essential \n\nfor our growth. \n\nWe are raising our sustainability profile, for example \n\nby submitting our emissions targets this year to the \n\nSBTi for validation, through public disclosures such \n\nas CDP and by taking into account the expectations \n\nof sustainability ratings agencies with the aim of \n\nimproving our scores. We are also proactive about \n\nour support for the environment and promote this \n\nto our employees. For example, we have: \n\n•• Employee-led sustainability committees \n\n•• An employee electric vehicle and cycle-to-work \n\nprogramme \n\n•• Flexible working hours (enabling employees \n\nto travel out of peak hours, cutting journey time \n\nand carbon emissions) \n\n•• Hybrid working (enabling staff to work from home \n\nsome of the time, reducing carbon emissions) \n\n•• Electric charging points in our staff car parks. \n\nUnder the various scenarios, STEPS would provide us \n\nwith the biggest opportunity to be leaders in our field. \n\nIn comparison, however, it might be more difficult to \n\nachieve our goals if government policy lags behind. \n\nNZE – minor \n\nAPS – minor \n\nSTEPS – moderate \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n51 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) continued \n\nTo reflect the importance of climate-\n\nrelated risks and our commitment to \n\nreporting against TCFD recommendations, \n\nclimate assessments are integrated into \n\nour overall enterprise risk management \n\n(ERM) framework. This is set out in our \n\nrisk report on pages 53 to 62 of this \n\nAnnual Report. Here, we summarise the \n\nrisk management process in relation to \n\nclimate-related risk. \n\nThis year, we have added an additional \n\nphysical risk relating to supply chains, \n\nwhich is part of a broader principal risk \n\n(see page 62 ). The remaining risks and \n\nopportunities remain the same, but we \n\nhave worked to quantify the financial risk \n\nagainst potential climate scenarios. \n\nBoard responsibilities – Audit \n\nCommittee \n\nThe authority for delivering the risk \n\nframework is delegated by our Board \n\nto the Audit Committee, which formally \n\nreviews our risk performance twice \n\na year, using our ERM framework. \n\nGiven the nature of our business, and \n\nthe risks and opportunities presented by \n\nclimate change (as set out in the tables \n\non pages 57 to 62), the most relevant \n\nclimate-related metrics and targets for our \n\nbusiness are in calculating and meeting \n\nour near-term and net zero carbon \n\nreduction targets. Below are the targets \n\nwe have set for carbon emissions, which \n\nwe submitted to the SBTi this year for \n\nvalidation (the targets for 2025/26 do not \n\nmeet SBTi’s criteria for validation because \n\nof their proximity in time, but we will \n\nmaintain these as business targets): \n\n•• To reduce our Scope 1 greenhouse \n\ngas (GHG) emissions by 50% by \n\n2025/26 and 60% by 2030/31 from \n\na baseline of 2020/21 \n\n•• To reduce our Scope 2 GHG emissions \n\nby 50% by 2025/26 and maintain a \n\n100% reduction by 2028/29 from \n\na baseline of 2020/21 \n\nSince 2022/23, the Audit Committee \n\nhas considered climate-related risks as a \n\nstanding item on its agenda, underlying the \n\nimportance of this area to our business. \n\nExecutive and operational \n\nmanagement \n\nOur CFO is the executive responsible for \n\noverseeing the implementation of our \n\nERM framework, and compliance with \n\nit across the Group. Risk management, \n\nwhich includes a review of climate-related \n\nrisks together with other risks faced by \n\nthe business, is a standing item on the \n\nagenda of our Executive Committee \n\nmeetings, and formal feedback on risk \n\nmanagement is integral to our operating \n\ncompany board meetings. This ensures \n\naccountability at each level for identifying, \n\nmonitoring and proactively managing \n\nrisk and compliance issues. Reviewing \n\nclimate risk also forms part of Bytes’ and \n\nPhoenix’s board agendas. This is set out \n\nin the risk management section of our \n\nrisk report on pages 54 to 56. \n\n•• To reduce our Scope 3 GHG \n\nemissions by 50% by 2030/31 \n\nfrom a baseline of 2022/23 \n\n•• To reach net zero GHG emissions \n\nacross the value chain by 2040/41. \n\nOur net zero target is based on absolute \n\nemissions, but we are measuring against \n\na revenue-intensity metric so we can \n\nassess the impact should the business \n\nsignificantly change. To meet our Scope 2 \n\ntargets, we also have a commitment to \n\nmaintain the purchase of 100% renewable \n\nelectricity for our owned offices. \n\nAnnual bonuses for executive directors \n\nare based on achieving financial and \n\nnon-financial targets, including an \n\nexternal ESG quality assessment. While \n\ndetailed performance targets aren’t \n\ndisclosed for the forthcoming year, the \n\noutcome of the 2023/24 ESG target, based \n\non the achievement of an ISS Quality and \n\nOur business processes ensure that \n\nthe policies, procedures and control \n\nenvironment set by the Board, and our \n\ncommitments on topics such as climate \n\nrisk, are understood and adhered to \n\nacross BTG. The factors we consider in \n\ndrafting policies and procedures include \n\nregulatory requirements, reputational and \n\nphysical risks, and our opportunities to \n\nadvise our customers on sustainable \n\ntechnology solutions. The evaluation \n\ncriteria include relevance to our industry \n\nand sustainability, regulatory and legal \n\nrisks, financial implications and the areas \n\nof our business affected. \n\nWe manage our environmental impacts \n\nthrough the framework of the ISO 14001 \n\nenvironmental management system. \n\nISO 14001 also requires that risks \n\nand opportunities be identified, and \n\nprocesses put in place to mitigate and \n\nmanage them.

Russia’s war in Ukraine \n\ncontinued unabated, contributing to \n\nhigher energy prices and inflation. As \n\ntensions rose across the Middle East after \n\nthe 7 October attack on Israel, strikes on \n\ncommercial ships in the Red Sea forced \n\ncompanies to pay higher insurance rates \n\nor a higher cost to reroute goods around \n\nsouthern Africa. Meanwhile, interest rates \n\nremained high. \n\nThis all served as a strong reminder of \n\nthe importance of having a robust, agile \n\napproach to managing risk. For us, risk \n\nmanagement is a journey, requiring \n\nreview throughout the year. It starts with \n\ndefining our risk appetite, which was \n\nunchanged this year, as we maintained \n\nour cautious approach. Our ERM \n\nframework enables us to identify and \n\nmanage risk, and we believe that it \n\ncontinues to serve us well. The changes \n\nwe made in 2022/23, by including risk \n\nmanagement as a standing agenda item \n\nat each of the subsidiary board meetings, \n\nhave solidified the Group’s bottom-up \n\napproach to risk. \n\nManaging existing risks and \n\nidentifying new ones \n\nThrough our ongoing risk monitoring \n\nprocess, we assess current and emerging \n\nrisks. The evolving geopolitical and \n\nmacroeconomic challenges this year \n\nincreased the potential for economic \n\ndisruption, especially as it affects our \n\ncustomers, which is one of our principal \n\nrisks. While we remain vigilant, our \n\nbusiness has performed strongly through \n\nvarious external crises in recent years, \n\ndemonstrating its resilience. \n\nSince our last Annual Report, we \n\nhave added two new principal risks, \n\nreclassified an emerging risk as a principal \n\nrisk and added one new emerging risk. \n\nThe first new principal risk relates to \n\nsupply chain management, because a \n\nfailure to monitor our suppliers could lead \n\nto reputational and financial damage. We \n\nalso note that escalating conflicts could \n\nalso affect our supply chain – although \n\nthe risks from the Red Sea shipping \n\ndisruptions are considered low because \n\nhardware is a comparatively small part of \n\nour business. The second new principal risk \n\nrelates to the regulatory and compliance \n\nlandscape, where changes in laws, \n\nregulations and industry standards \n\ncould significantly affect our operations, \n\nfinancial stability and reputation. \n\nIn 2022/23, our primary emerging risk \n\nwas climate change and sustainability. \n\nThis year, the Group Risk Committee \n\ndecided to elevate sustainability and ESG \n\nto a principal risk, given fast-changing \n\nregulatory requirements and enhanced \n\nscrutiny from stakeholders around \n\nreporting and disclosure requirements. \n\nThe physical risk from climate change \n\nremains unchanged as an emerging risk, \n\nas does our second emerging risk from \n\n2022/23, around keeping pace with \n\nsocial change. \n\nThis year we identified a third emerging \n\nrisk, related to artificial intelligence (AI) \n\nand what it means for our customers. The \n\npotential AI risks include moral, legal and \n\nethical issues relating to the information \n\nsources that the technology is trained \n\non and extracting data from, and the \n\nsocial issues arising from the potential \n\nreplacement of human roles in the \n\nworkplace. However, for our business \n\ndirectly, we consider AI to be an opportunity, \n\nbecause we provide support and sell AI \n\nproducts to our customers. \n\nIncreasing the scope \n\nof internal audit \n\nFor nearly three years, we’ve been \n\nworking closely with PwC as our internal \n\naudit partner. We have a good relationship \n\nand believe the partnership adds significant \n\nvalue to our risk management. This year, \n\ndifferent PwC teams, outside the internal \n\naudit team, performed additional work \n\ndocumenting some of our key processes, \n\nincluding general IT controls, tax and \n\ngovernance, which maintains independence. \n\nConsidering the growth of our business, \n\nwe’ve asked PwC to increase its capacity \n\nby 15% to enhance assurance as we \n\ncontinue to grow. \n\nWhile we will never be complacent, I’m \n\nconfident that the steps we took this year, \n\ncombined with our ongoing and careful \n\nrisk management, mean we will remain \n\nresilient in the year ahead. \n\nAndrew Holden \n\nCFO \n\n22 May 2024 \n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2023/24 \n\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n53 \n\nRISK REPORT Risk management \n\nHow we manage risk \n\nBTG operates within the information \n\nand communications technology sector \n\nin the UK and Ireland. This means we \n\nare exposed to the risks that financial, \n\npolitical, regulatory, technological and \n\nlegal events might bring – risks that could \n\nadversely affect how or whether we \n\nachieve our strategic, operational, \n\ncompliance and reporting objectives. \n\nBased on our ERM framework, our \n\napproach to risk identifies and addresses \n\nany potential barriers to achieving our \n\nstrategic objectives and to making \n\nthe most of opportunities for \n\ncompetitive advantage. \n\nOur ERM-based approach \n\nThe purpose of ERM is to achieve three \n\nkey objectives: \n\n•• Oversight – all critical risks are \n\nidentified across BTG, and managed \n\nand monitored using a holistic \n\napproach that is consistent with \n\nour approved risk appetite \n\n•• Ownership and responsibility – the \n\nownership of risk is assigned to individual \n\nsenior managers, who are responsible \n\nfor identifying, evaluating, mitigating \n\nand reporting our risk exposure \n\n•• Assurance – the Board, its committees, \n\nBTG’s Executive Committee and \n\noperational management have \n\nreasonable assurance that we are \n\nmanaging risk appropriately within \n\ndefined levels, and so that it brings \n\nvalue to our organisation. \n\nThis ERM framework is the foundation of \n\nour risk management approach.

In identifying risks, \n\nthe Board is supported by our executives \n\nand managers across our business who \n\nare experts in their respective areas – for \n\nexample, our cybersecurity specialists \n\nmonitor cyberthreats. \n\nBTG’s directors have committed \n\nthe organisation to a process of \n\nrisk management that is aligned to \n\nthe principles of the UK Corporate \n\nGovernance Code, the Committee \n\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the \n\nTreadway Commission and the ISO 31000 \n\nIntegrated Enterprise Risk Management \n\nFramework. The ERM methodologies are \n\nalso defined through continued research \n\nand development, and are benchmarked \n\nagainst international best practice. \n\nAlthough, through the Audit Committee, \n\nour Board has overall responsibility \n\nfor risk – including establishing and \n\nmaintaining our risk management \n\nframework and internal control systems, \n\nand setting our risk appetite – everyone \n\nat BTG plays a part in protecting our \n\nbusiness from risk and making the \n\nmost of our opportunities. \n\nNo matter how diligently we monitor our \n\nenvironment or scrutinise sophisticated \n\nglobal intelligence data, risks can appear \n\nand accelerate with little or no warning. \n\nWe remain confident that the time, \n\nresources and effort we have invested, \n\nand will continue to invest, in managing \n\nrisk have prepared and equipped us to \n\nmanage threats effectively. We believe \n\nthis means we can provide our business, \n\npeople and customers with reasonable \n\nassurance of staying secure, and so \n\ncontinue to benefit from the opportunities \n\nin our sector. \n\nOur primary emerging risk \n\nIn 2022/23, our primary emerging risk \n\nwas climate change and sustainability. \n\nIn October 2023, the Risk Committee \n\nagreed to elevate sustainability and ESG \n\nto a principal risk, given ever-evolving \n\nregulatory requirements, as well as \n\nenhanced and more in-depth reporting \n\nand disclosure requirements being \n\nexpected by our stakeholders, including \n\ncustomers and investors (see page 62 ). \n\nThe climate-related physical and transition \n\nrisks remain as an emerging risk, because \n\nthese risks are not yet materially affecting \n\nour business in the short to medium term \n\n(see pages 44 to 52). \n\nOur Board manages and monitors \n\nemerging risks closely, with oversight \n\nfrom the Audit Committee. We put climate \n\nchange and sustainability under particular \n\nscrutiny in 2023/24, fully calculating our \n\nScope 3 emissions and submitting our \n\nnear-term and net zero carbon reduction \n\ntargets to the Science Based Targets \n\ninitiative (SBTi). \n\nClimate change \n\nThe physical impacts of climate change \n\nare a potential risk to our people and \n\nfacilities, and to those of our customers \n\nand suppliers. Climate change’s effects \n\non the economic landscape, technology \n\nuse and regulation could also be a threat. \n\nWhile we’re working to reduce our \n\nown impact on the climate, as a non-\n\nmanufacturing business the greatest \n\ncontribution we can make to alleviating \n\nclimate change is by supporting our \n\ncustomers to use technology in a \n\nsustainable way – particularly by moving \n\ntheir IT products and services to the cloud. \n\nTo reduce our own environmental impact, \n\nin 2022/23 we relaunched our \n\nSustainability Framework. This sets out \n\nour sustainability governance and targets, \n\nand how we will monitor and measure our \n\nprogress. During 2022/23, as well as \n\nsubmitting our targets to the SBTi, we \n\nsubmitted our first scoring disclosure to \n\nCDP. We also remain certified by the ISO \n\n14001 environmental operating system. \n\nOur approach supports organisations that \n\nare committed to working with sustainable \n\nsuppliers, in line with our strategy of \n\ndelivering high-net-value solutions. \n\nOur Board continues to analyse what \n\nchallenges could emerge from more \n\nclimate change-related legislation or \n\ncommitments by government, and \n\ntheir impacts on this emerging risk. \n\nOur secondary emerging risk \n\nIn 2022/23, we identified a second \n\nemerging risk around social change, \n\nwhich we reviewed in the second half of \n\n2023/24 and still consider to be emerging. \n\nYounger generations and post-pandemic \n\nattitudes could change the way we work \n\nand how we need to respond to our \n\npeople. To identify changes, we are \n\nclosely monitoring our recruitment, \n\nattrition rate and insights from staff, and \n\nwe review this risk at every opportunity. \n\nKeeping pace with social change \n\nOur customer and talent pool might be \n\nlimited if we are not seen as a progressive \n\norganisation. People, particularly of a \n\nyounger age, are looking to engage with \n\ncompanies that do the right thing when \n\nit comes to being a responsible part of \n\nsociety. As younger generations join the \n\nworkforce, we are starting to see changes \n\nin expectations around work-life balance. \n\nThis is seen through generational and \n\nwider cultural change, as well as since \n\nthe Covid-19 pandemic, and has led \n\nsome to reconsider their life goals. \n\n> Annual Report and Accounts 2023/24\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n> 55\n\nWe have long identified that our staff \n\nneed more than just to be well paid: they \n\nneed opportunities to develop, flexibility \n\nin their working arrangements and for \n\nthe business to feel like a cultural fit. \n\nWe continue to take steps to meet these \n\nexpectations, and to build on the actions \n\nalready taken – such as increasing the \n\ninitial annual leave allowance, introducing \n\ncompany-wide personal development \n\nplans for all staff and increasing maternity \n\npay. We have also introduced the option \n\nfor staff to take two additional wellness \n\ndays each year, plus a volunteering day. \n\nWe regularly listen to our employees \n\nthrough Insights submissions and forums, \n\nand we encourage a culture of openness. \n\nGenerational changes have also brought \n\nmore open minds, particularly in relation \n\nto gender, race, religion, sexual orientation \n\nand a desire to treat everyone equally – as \n\nwell as to accommodating and celebrating \n\ndifference. We already hold these values \n\nat our core, but need to continually \n\nmonitor and keep pace with these changes. \n\nNot doing so could affect our ability to \n\nattract and retain not only employees but \n\ncustomers, when they also start to reflect \n\nnew social values and require their supply \n\nchain to do the same. \n\nOur tertiary emerging risk \n\nIn October 2023, we identified a third \n\nemerging risk from AI and the impact this \n\nmight have on our customers and their \n\nemployees. At the moment, we consider \n\nAI and machine learning an opportunity \n\nfor our business, as we expand sales into \n\nareas such as Microsoft’s Copilot and \n\nsupport our customers to capitalise on \n\nthis emerging technology. \n\nHowever, as well as opportunities, \n\nAI brings several inherent risks. These \n\npotential risks come from moral, legal and \n\nethical issues, relating to the information \n\nsources that the AI technology is trained \n\non and extracting data from, with potential \n\ncopyright and other legal issues, and \n\nthe potential replacement of many \n\nroles in the workplace in the longer term. \n\nWe will discuss and review these through \n\nour ERM approach to risk management \n\nas the technology develops and its wider \n\nimpact is better understood. \n\nRight now, having fewer users within our \n\ncustomer base would negatively affect \n\nour profitability. And those most likely \n\nto be replaced with AI in the future \n\nare people who work with technology, \n\nrather than those who do manual work. \n\nGenAI may also present a cybersecurity \n\nrisk because, as it develops, the \n\ntool will allow for more sophisticated \n\nimpersonation, such as deepfakes. These \n\ncould be used in several ways to cause \n\nfinancial and reputational damage, including \n\nmore convincing phishing attacks or ‘fake’ \n\nvideos conveying incorrect information. \n\nThere is uncertainty about how, where and \n\nto what extent AI will affect society too. As \n\nsuch, our business will continue to review \n\nthe risks and opportunities presented by \n\nthis and other emerging technologies. \n\nIn 2023/24, the economic situation \n\nremained as uncertain as last financial \n\nyear, with the crisis continuing in Ukraine, \n\nincreased inflation and uncertain \n\ngeopolitics. Although we performed \n\nstrongly and managed risks well last year, \n\nwe have amended our principal and \n\nemerging risks to account for changes \n\nin the market and society, and with our \n\nvendors. We now have 14 rather than 11 \n\nprincipal risks, taking into account the \n\nfollowing changes. \n\n•• The risks called Economic disruption \n\nand Inflation have been amended. \n\nEconomic disruption now focuses \n\non economic impacts affecting \n\nour customers, while Inflation now \n\nfocuses on the internal effect on \n\nour employees. \n\n•• The risk called Increasing debtor risk \n\nhas expanded and been renamed \n\nWorking capital. It now includes the \n\nfinancial risk of an increased aged \n\ndebt profile, as well as creditors \n\nand the risk of vendors changing \n\ntheir payment terms. \n\n•• We have expanded our definition of \n\nthe risk called Competition to include \n\nthe evolving competitor landscape, \n\nsuch as through AI and marketplaces. \n\n•• The risk called Relevance and emerging \n\ntechnology now incorporates the cost \n\nof staying current, and includes the \n\ncost of additional resources as well \n\nas upgrading the technologies we \n\nuse and sell. \n\n•• We have expanded the risk called \n\nBusiness continuity failure to include risk \n\nto and from people – like insider threats. \n\n•• Under the risk called Attract and retain \n\nstaff while keeping our culture, we have \n\namended a widespread IT shortage to \n\na shortage in emerging areas, such as \n\nAI, where expertise is in high demand. \n\n•• The risk called Climate change and \n\nsustainability has risen from being an \n\nemerging risk to a principal risk called \n\nSustainability/ESG. The physical \n\nthreats from climate change will remain \n\nas emerging, but the elevated principal \n\nrisk is about keeping up with regulatory \n\nrequirement changes and staying ahead \n\nof expectations from stakeholders. \n\n•• We have added a new principal risk \n\ncalled Supply chain management. \n\nThe risk is based on the time and effort \n\nneeded to manage the supply chain \n\ngiven increasing focus on compliance, \n\naudits, sustainability and reporting. \n\n•• We have added another new principal \n\nrisk called Regulatory and compliance, \n\nwhich relates to the inherent risks from \n\nevolving regulatory and compliance \n\nlandscapes. \n\n•• We are monitoring our new emerging \n\nrisk around the impact of AI and machine \n\nlearning. This technology has the \n\npotential to change the internal IT and \n\nworking landscape and to present risks \n\nfrom moral, legal and ethical standpoints. \n\nRisk management continued \n\n# Our principal risks and uncertainties \n\n56 Bytes Technology Group plc \n\nRISK REPORT Financial  1 Economic disruption Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nThis risk includes the impact of the crises in Palestine \n\nand the Red Sea and the continuing conflict in Ukraine. \n\nIt encompasses the uncertainties caused by global \n\neconomic pressures and geopolitical risk within the UK. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nWe have so far continued to perform well during high inflation, \n\nthe conflict in Ukraine and the UK leaving the EU, as well as \n\nduring the current cost-of-living crisis, disruption to shipping \n\nthrough the Red Sea and the Israel–Palestine conflict. \n\nThese real-life experiences of high inflation, rising cost of \n\nliving, Covid-19, exchange rate fluctuations and the UK \n\nleaving the EU have shown us to be resilient through tough \n\neconomic conditions. The diversity of our client base has \n\nalso helped us maintain and increase business in this \n\nperiod. We are not complacent, however – economic \n\ndisruption remains a risk and we keep our operations \n\nunder constant review. \n\nOur continued focus on software asset management \n\nmeans that we advise customers of the most cost-effective \n\nways to fulfil their software needs. Changes to economic \n\nconditions mean many organisations will look to IT to drive \n\ngrowth and/or efficiency. \n\nExternally, we have seen more customers looking to \n\navoid increased staff costs through outsourcing their \n\nIT to managed services. This may create an opportunity \n\nto accelerate our service offerings. \n\nThe impact \n\nMajor economic disruption and potentially higher taxes \n\ncould see reduced demand for software licensing, \n\nhardware and IT services, which could be compounded by \n\ngovernment controls. Lower demand could also arise from \n\nreduced customer budgets, cautious spending patterns or \n\nclients ‘making do’ with existing IT. Increased costs from \n\nshipping diversions away from the Red Sea could have time \n\nand cost implications for imported goods. \n\nEconomic disruption could also affect the major financial \n\nmarkets, including currencies, interest rates and the cost of \n\nborrowing. The high inflation rates seen in 2022 and 2023 \n\nhave decreased but are still above target rates. Economic \n\ndeterioration like this could have an impact on our business \n\nperformance and profitability. Inflationary pressure could \n\nstill create an environment in which customers redirect their \n\nspending from new IT projects to more pressing needs. \n\n2 Margin pressure Risk owner MDs of subsidiary businesses \n\nThe risk \n\nBTG faces pressure on profit margins from myriad \n\ndirections, including increased competition, changes in \n\nvendors’ commercial behaviour, certain offerings being \n\ncommoditised and changes in customer mix or preferences. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nProfit margins are affected by many factors at customer \n\nand micro levels. \n\nWe can control some of the factors that influence our \n\nmargins but some, such as economic and political factors, \n\nare beyond our control. \n\nIn the past year we have again sought to increase margins \n\nwhere possible, while cost increases from vendors have \n\ngrown our margins organically. Our diverse portfolio of \n\nofferings, with a mix of vendors, software and services, \n\nhas enabled us to absorb any changes – and we continue \n\nto innovate to find new ways to deliver more value for our \n\ncustomers. Services delivered internally are consistently \n\nmeasured against our competition to ensure we remain \n\ncompetitive and maximise margins. \n\nWe aim to agree acceptable profit margins with \n\ncustomers upfront. \n\nKeeping the correct level of certification by vendor, early \n\ndeal registration and rebate management are three \n\nmethods we use to make sure we are procuring at the \n\nlowest cost and maximising the incentives we earn. \n\nThis risk area is reviewed monthly. \n\nThe impact \n\nThese changes could have an impact on our business \n\nperformance and profitability. \n\n> Changes since last financial year\n> Increase\n> No change\n> Decrease\n> Annual Report and Accounts 2023/24\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n> 57 Financial\n\n3 Changes to vendors’ commercial model Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nWe receive incentive income from our vendors and their \n\ndistributors. This partially offsets our costs of sales \n\nbut could be significantly reduced or eliminated if \n\nthe commercial models are changed significantly. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nWe maintain a diverse portfolio of vendor products and \n\nservices. Although we receive major sources of funding \n\nfrom specific vendor programmes, if one source declines, \n\nwe can offset it by gaining new certifications in, and selling, \n\nother technologies where new funding is available. Where \n\nvendors have changed, such as Broadcom purchasing \n\nVMware, we have also seen AWS and Dell increasingly \n\nembrace the reseller community. So, overall, for BTG \n\nthe severity of this risk is unchanged. \n\nWe closely monitor incentive income and make sure staff are \n\naligned to meet vendors’ goals so that we don’t lose out on \n\nthese incentives. Close and regular communication with all \n\nour major vendors and distributors means we can manage \n\nthis risk appropriately. In some areas we have seen a positive \n\nchange in vendors’ commercial terms, where we have been \n\nable to adapt practices. \n\nThe materiality of this risk has not been realised yet, \n\nbut it remains a risk. \n\nThe impact \n\nThese incentives are very valuable and contribute to our \n\noperational profits. Significant changes to the commercial \n\nmodels could put pressure on our profitability. \n\n4 Inflation Risk owner CFO \n\nThe risk \n\nInflation in the UK, as measured by the Consumer Price \n\nIndex (CPI), was 10.1% in March 2023 and more than \n\nhalved to 3.2% by March 2024. This rate is above the \n\nBank of England’s target of 2%, although expectations \n\nsuggest it could be 2% by the second half of 2024. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nStaffing costs make up most of our overheads, so our \n\nattention has been focused on our employees and their \n\nability to cope with the rising cost of living. \n\nAt the start of 2023/24, varying levels of wage increases \n\nwere rolled out for our employees, with a greater \n\npercentage increase for lower-paid staff. This was to help \n\nour employees maintain their standard of living and be able \n\nto keep up with essentials such as rent and mortgage \n\npayments, and energy and food bills. \n\nThe impact \n\nWage inflation and increased fuel and energy costs \n\nhave a direct impact on our underlying cost base. \n\nIf our competitors increase wages to a higher level, \n\nthen we potentially have a risk for retaining and \n\nattracting employees and customers. \n\n5 Working capital Risk owner CFO \n\nThe risk \n\nAs customers face the challenges of inflation and elevated \n\ninterest rates in the current economic environment, there \n\nis a greater risk of an increasing aged debt profile, with \n\ncustomers slower to pay and the possibility of bad debts. \n\nVendors’ changing payment terms could also have a \n\nsignificant impact. \n\nIn 2023/24, we have seen debtor days stabilise as inflation has \n\nreduced, but the number of days is yet to return to base level. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nOur credit collections teams are focused on collecting \n\ncustomer debts on time and maintaining our debtor days at \n\nor below target levels. Debt collection is reported and \n\nanalysed continually and escalated to senior management \n\nas required. In the past financial year, BTG hasn’t had any \n\nsignificant bad debt or write-offs. \n\nA large part of a successful outcome is maintaining strong, \n\nopen relationships with our customers, understanding their \n\nissues and ensuring our billing systems deliver accurate, \n\nclear and timely invoicing so that queries can be quickly \n\nresolved. \n\nThe impact \n\nThis could adversely affect our businesses’ profitability \n\nand/or cash flow. \n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties continued   \n\n> 58 Bytes Technology Group plc\n> RISK REPORT Strategic\n\n6 Vendor concentration Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nOver-reliance on any one technology or supplier could pose \n\na potential risk, should that technology be superseded or \n\nexposed to economic down cycles, or if the vendor fails to \n\ninnovate ahead of customer demands. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nWe work with our vendors as partners – it is a relationship of \n\nmutual dependency because we are their route to the end \n\ncustomer. We maintain excellent relationships with all our \n\nvendors, and have a particularly good relationship with \n\nMicrosoft, which relies on us as a key partner in the UK. \n\nOur growth plans, which involve developing business with \n\nall our vendors, will naturally reduce the risk of relying too \n\nheavily on any single one. \n\nHardware is not a core element of our business but is \n\na steady sector, so we monitor supply closely. We also \n\nmonitor the geopolitical situation continually and work \n\nclosely with suppliers to stay fully informed, so that we \n\ncan respond quickly should the landscape change. With \n\na diverse portfolio of suppliers and vendors, we are able \n\nto offer alternatives to customers if there is a particular \n\nvendor with a supply issue. Given this risk is largely driven \n\nby geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, we maintain \n\na watching brief so that we can react swiftly if we need to. \n\nThe impact \n\nRelying too heavily on any one vendor could have an \n\nadverse effect on our financial performance, should that \n\nrelationship break down. \n\nGeopolitically, global shortages of computer hardware, \n\ncomponents and chips could occur, which might limit our \n\nand our customers’ ability to purchase hardware for internal \n\nuse. This could lead to delays in customers purchasing \n\nsoftware that is linked to, or dependent on, the hardware \n\nbeing available. Reduced access to computer chips could \n\nalso slow down vendor innovation, leading to delays in \n\ncreating new technology to resell to customers. \n\nUptake of AI is expected to increase rapidly. While this \n\nrepresents an opportunity, the development of AI by a handful \n\nof companies, including Microsoft, has the potential to further \n\nconcentrate revenue and profit across fewer vendors. \n\nThis risk is also heightened by changes to shipping routes, \n\nif certain channels are made unsafe. \n\n7 Competition Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nCompetition in the UK IT market, or the commoditisation \n\nof IT products, may result in BTG being unable to win or \n\nmaintain market share. \n\nMergers and acquisitions have consolidated our \n\ndistribution network and absorbed specialist services \n\ncompanies. This has caused overlap with our own \n\nofferings. \n\nA move to direct vendor resale to end customers \n\n(disintermediation) could place more pressure on \n\nthe market opportunity. Platforms, like marketplaces, \n\nwith direct sales to customers, could also be seen \n\nas disintermediation. \n\nFrameworks, particularly in the public sector, are a \n\nprocurement route of choice for some customers. We risk \n\nnarrowing our route to customers if we are not part of these \n\nframeworks. \n\nAI risks becoming a partial competitor, if it becomes able to \n\nprovide accurate and beneficial licensing and infrastructure \n\nadvice direct to customers. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nWe closely watch commercial and technological \n\ndevelopments in our markets. \n\nThe threat of disintermediation by vendors has always been \n\npresent. We minimise this threat by continuing to increase \n\nthe added value we bring to customers directly. This \n\nreduces clients’ desire to deal directly with vendors. \n\nEqually, vendors cannot engage with myriad organisations \n\nglobally without the sort of well-established network of \n\nintermediaries that we have. \n\nWe currently work with AWS Marketplace and can sell to \n\nour vendors through its platform, which gives discounts \n\nto the customer versus buying directly. \n\nAI/machine learning has been identified as a new emerging \n\nrisk, and so will be explored and monitored for risks and \n\nopportunities to our business. \n\nCurrently, there is no sign of any commoditisation that \n\nwould be a serious threat to our business model in the \n\nshort or medium term. \n\nThe impact \n\nThis risk could have a material, adverse impact on our \n\nbusiness and profitability, potentially needing a shift in \n\nbusiness operations, including a strategic overhaul of the \n\nproducts, solutions and services that we offer to the market. \n\nMore consolidation could lead to less competition between \n\nvendors and cause prices to value-added resellers, like us, \n\nto rise and service levels to fall. Direct resale to customers \n\ncould also increase. This could erode reseller margins, \n\ngiven the purchase cost is less for the distributor than the \n\nreseller. This could reduce our market, margin and profits. \n\n> Annual Report and Accounts 2023/24\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n> 59 Strategic\n\n8 Relevance and emerging technology Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nAs the technology and security markets evolve rapidly and \n\nbecome more complex, the risk exists that we might not \n\nkeep pace and so fail to be considered for new \n\nopportunities by our customers. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nWe stay relevant to our customers by: \n\nփ Continuing to offer them expert advice and \n\ninnovative solutions \n\nփ Specialising in high-demand areas \n\nփ Holding superior levels of certification \n\nփ Maintaining our good reputation and helping clients \n\nfind the right solutions in a complex, often confusing \n\nIT marketplace. \n\nWe defend our position by keeping abreast of new \n\ntechnologies and the innovators who develop them. \n\nWe do this, for example, by running a cyber accelerator \n\nprogramme for new and emerging solution providers, \n\njoining industry forums and sitting on new technology \n\ncommittees. We have expanded the number and range \n\nof our subject-matter experts, who stay ahead of \n\ndevelopments in their areas and communicate this \n\ninternally and externally. \n\nBy identifying and developing bonds with emerging \n\ncompanies, we maintain good relationships with them \n\nas they grow and give our customers access to their \n\ntechnologies. This is core to our business, so the risk \n\nfrom this is relatively low. \n\nThe impact \n\nCustomers have wide choice and endless opportunities to \n\nresearch options. If we do not offer cutting-edge products \n\nand relevant services, we could lose sales and customers, \n\nwhich would affect our profitability. \n\n> Processes and systems\n\n9 Cyberthreats – direct and indirect Risk owner Chief Information Security Officer \n\nThe risk \n\nBreaches in the security of electronic and other \n\nconfidential information that BTG collects, processes, \n\nstores and transmits may give rise to significant liabilities \n\nand reputational damage. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nWe use intelligence-driven analysis, including research by \n\nour internal digital forensics team, to protect ourselves. \n\nThis work provides insights into vulnerable areas and the \n\neffects of any breaches, which allow us to strengthen our \n\nsecurity controls. \n\nWe have established controls that separate customer \n\nsystems and mitigate cross-breaches. Our cyberthreat-\n\nlevel system also lets us tailor our approach and controls in \n\nline with any intelligence we receive. Our two subsidiaries \n\nshare insights and examples of good practice on security \n\ncontrols with one another – and the security operations \n\ncentre located at Phoenix’s offices provides the whole \n\nbusiness with up-to-date threat analysis. \n\nThe impact \n\nIf a hacker accessed our IT systems, they might infiltrate \n\none or more of our customer areas. This could provide \n\nindirect access, or the intelligence required to compromise \n\nor access a customer environment. \n\nThis would increase the chance of first- and third-party risk \n\nliability, with the possible effects of regulatory breaches, \n\nloss of confidence in our business, reputational damage \n\nand potential financial penalties. \n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties continued   \n\n> 60 Bytes Technology Group plc\n> RISK REPORT Operational\n\n10 Business continuity failure Risk owner CFO \n\nThe risk \n\nAny failure or disruption of BTG’s people, processes and IT \n\ninfrastructure may negatively affect our ability to deliver to \n\nour customers, cause reputational damage and lose us \n\nmarket share. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nOur Chief Technology Officer and Head of IT manage \n\nand oversee our IT infrastructure, network, systems \n\nand business applications. All our operational teams \n\nare focused on the latest vendor products and educate \n\nsales teams appropriately. \n\nRegular IT audits have identified areas for improvement, \n\nwhile ongoing reviews make sure we have a high level of \n\ncompliance and uptime. This means our systems are highly \n\neffective and fit for purpose. \n\nFor business continuity, we use different sites and solutions \n\nto limit the impact of service outage to customers. Where \n\npossible, we use active resilience solutions – designed to \n\nwithstand or prevent loss of services in an unplanned event \n\n– rather than just disaster-recovery solutions and facilities, \n\nwhich restore normal operations after an incident. \n\nEmployees are encouraged to work from home or take \n\ntime off when sick, to avoid transmitting illness within the \n\nworkplace. We also have processes to make sure there \n\nisn’t a single point of failure, and that resiliency is built into \n\nemployees’ skillsets. \n\nIncreased automation means a heavier reliance on \n\ntechnology. Although it can reduce human error, it can \n\nalso potentially increase our reliance on other vendors. \n\nOur efforts to reduce the risk from insider threats are \n\nmultifaceted and involve pre-employment screening, \n\ncontracts, training, identifying higher-risk individuals \n\nand technology to reduce potential data loss. This risk \n\nis reviewed through frequent vulnerability assessments. \n\nThe impact \n\nSystems and IT infrastructure are key to our operational \n\neffectiveness. Failures or significant downtime could hinder \n\nour ability to serve customers, sell solutions or invoice. \n\nMajor outages in systems that provide customer services \n\ncould limit clients’ ability to extract crucial information from \n\ntheir systems or manage their software. \n\nPeople are a huge part of our operational success, and \n\nprocesses rely on people as much as technology to deliver \n\neffectively to our customers. Insider threats, intentional \n\nor otherwise, could compromise our ability to deliver and \n\ndamage our reputation. Employee illness and absence – if \n\nin significant numbers, such as a communicable disease in \n\na particular team – could make effective delivery difficult. \n\n11 Attract and retain staff while keeping our culture Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nThe success of BTG’s business and growth strategy \n\ndepends on our ability to attract, recruit and retain a \n\ntalented employee base. Being able to offer competitive \n\nremuneration is an important part of this. \n\nThree factors are affecting this: \n\nփ Inflation, which is still influencing salary expectations \n\nand wage growth \n\nփ Skills shortage in emerging, high-demand areas, \n\nsuch as AI and machine learning \n\nփ With remote or hybrid working becoming the norm, \n\npotential employees in traditionally lower-paid \n\ngeographical regions being able to work remotely \n\nin higher-paying areas like London. \n\nMaintaining our BTG culture also affects how we attract \n\nand retain staff, which might be affected by growth. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nWe continually strive to be the best company to work for \n\nin our sector. \n\nOne of the ways we manage this risk is by growing our own \n\ntalent pools. We’ve used this approach successfully in our \n\ngraduate intakes for sales, for example. BTG also runs an \n\nextensive apprenticeship programme across multiple \n\nbusiness divisions. We also review the time that \n\nmanagement has to coach new staff. \n\nMaintaining our culture is important to retaining current \n\nstaff. We maintain our small-company feel through regular \n\ncommunications, clubs, charity events and social events. \n\nWe aim to absorb growth while keeping our culture. \n\nThe impact \n\nExcessive wage inflation could either drive up costs or \n\nmean we are unable to attract or retain the talent pool \n\nwe need to continue to deliver our planned growth. \n\n> Annual Report and Accounts 2023/24\n> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT  GOVERNANCE REPORT\n> 61 Operational\n\n12 Supply chain management Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nFailure to understand suppliers may lead to regulatory, \n\nreputational and financial risks, if they expose our \n\nbusiness to practices that we would not tolerate in our \n\nown operations. The time and effort to monitor and audit \n\nsuppliers is considered a risk. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nSupplier set-up forms include questions to ask suppliers to \n\ndisclose information relating to compliance and adherence \n\nto our Supplier Code of Conduct. Any unethical, illegal or \n\ncorrupt behaviour that comes to light is escalated and \n\nappropriate action is taken. \n\nPhoenix has appointed a procurement manager and Bytes \n\nhas established a cross-disciplinary group to work on \n\nmanaging suppliers. \n\nWe consider the impact from shipping risks to be lower, \n\ngiven that only a small part of our profit and revenue \n\ncome from hardware. \n\nThe impact \n\nManaging supply chains is important to the sustainability \n\nof the business from a legal, financial, reputational, ethical \n\nand environmental viewpoint. \n\nThere is a risk to our business if we engage with suppliers that: \n\nփ Provide unethical working conditions and pay \n\nփ Are involved in financial mismanagement and \n\nunethical behaviour \n\nփ Cause environmental damage \n\nփ Operate in sanctioned regions. \n\nEscalating conflicts could also affect our supply chain – for \n\nexample, rerouting shipping around southern Africa adds \n\njourney time and increases carbon emissions. \n\n> Regulatory\n\n13 Sustainability/ESG Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nThe growing importance of sustainability and ESG for our \n\ncustomers, investors and employees means we need to stay \n\nat the forefront of reporting and disclosure, especially given \n\nthat requirements and standards are continually updated. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nOur Board manages and monitors this risk closely, \n\nwith oversight from the Audit Committee. \n\nThe Group sustainability manager continues to drive \n\nsustainability reporting and initiatives, and to work with an \n\nappointed third party to provide guidance and assurance \n\non reported data. \n\nOur Sustainability Steering Committee enables decision \n\nmakers from across the Group and our two operating \n\ncompanies to work towards a common goal and report \n\non challenges. \n\nDisclosures are made through several channels, including \n\nCDP. We submitted our carbon reduction targets to the \n\nSBTi in December 2023, as part of our programme to drive \n\nsustainability through best practice approaches. Feedback \n\nfrom disclosures is used to guide changes in the business. \n\nSo, as disclosure methodologies stay current, so should \n\nthe business, where possible and relevant. \n\nThe impact \n\nFalling behind expectations or our peers may lead to \n\nchallenges around: \n\nփ Legal compliance, such as adhering to global standards \n\nփ Retaining customers, as they push to reduce emissions \n\nփ Investor relations, such as meeting criteria for ESG funds \n\nփ Attracting and retaining employees, as younger \n\ngenerations seek to work for more purpose-driven \n\nbusinesses. \n\n14 Regulatory and compliance Risk owner CEO \n\nThe risk \n\nOur business faces inherent risks from evolving regulatory \n\nand compliance landscapes. Changes in laws, regulations \n\nand industry standards could significantly affect our \n\noperations, financial stability and reputation. \n\nHow we manage it \n\nWe engage external experts. BTG works closely with external \n\nauthorities, including through internal and external audits \n\nand paid-for consultancy, to advise on expected changes \n\nto regulations and the Group’s response to them. \n\nWe monitor regulatory developments. Individuals with \n\nresponsibilities in the business stay up to date with changes \n\nin their field through professional memberships and trade \n\npublications, and through directly following regulatory and \n\ncompliance bodies. \n\nWe work to enhance internal controls. Compliance teams \n\nin each operating company hold a register of policies and \n\norganise reviews, updates and sign-offs with policy owners \n\nto make sure policies are kept current. \n\nOur steering committees, operating company board \n\nmeetings and BTG Board meetings are forums for raising and \n\ndiscussing changes that affect multiple areas of the business. \n\nThe impact \n\nOperational teams and processes face administrative \n\nburdens and effects under rapidly changing regulations. \n\nFailing to keep up with regulatory, reporting and \n\ncompliance changes could lead to fines, legal challenges \n\nand reputational damage. \n\nIf regulatory compliance is not maintained, there are risks \n\nto the company and to individuals, which could lead to \n\nexpensive legal challenges and reputational damage \n\nto the business among all stakeholders. \n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties continued   \n\n> 62 Bytes Technology Group plc\n> RISK REPORT\n\n# Non-financial and sustainability \n\n# information statement \n\nWe are required to include a non-financial information statement in our strategic report, under Sections 414CA and 414CB of \n\nthe Companies Act 2006, as amended by The Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and Non-Financial Reporting) \n\nRegulations 2016.

They believe this \n\nis the most appropriate and realistic time \n\nover which they can anticipate events and \n\nassess how existing risks are developing \n\nand new risks emerging. \n\nOperationally, this is the time over which \n\nBTG has a view of: \n\n•• Major customer contracts, typically \n\nMicrosoft Enterprise Agreements, \n\nwhich run for three years \n\n•• The extension of our main public \n\nsector framework agreement \n\nwith Crown Commercial Services \n\n(RM6098 Technology Products & \n\nAssociated Services 2 (TePAS 2)) \n\nto 7 October 2027 \n\n•• The availability of external funding from \n\nour HSBC revolving credit facility, which \n\nruns until May 2026 and includes an \n\noptional one-year extension to 17 May \n\n2027, so covering the whole of the \n\nviability period, if required. This facility \n\nhas never been drawn against to date \n\nand our cash flow forecasts for the next \n\nthree years show that it is unlikely to \n\nbe so in that period. BTG will consider \n\nextending the facility if required closer \n\nto its end date, and currently does not \n\nforesee this being an issue. \n\nThe Board has performed a robust risk \n\nassessment of the principal risks and \n\nuncertainties facing BTG, as outlined \n\non pages 53 to 62. These are risks that \n\nmay pose a threat to our future financial \n\nperformance, our ability to meet future \n\ncommitments and liabilities as they fall \n\ndue, and the ongoing viability of our \n\nbusiness model. \n\nMost recently, in light of the changes within \n\nthe Board itself, notably the resignation of \n\nthe former CEO at the end of 2023/24 and \n\nthe appointment of the new CEO in May \n\n2024, the Board has further assessed if \n\nthere could be an associated potential loss \n\nof revenues, if relationships with customers \n\nor suppliers are affected, or if there could \n\nbe an adverse effect on staff and culture \n\nmore generally, which could make it harder \n\nto retain and recruit. Having passed the \n\ninitial phase of change and publicity around \n\nit, at an operational level we have seen no \n\nadverse reaction from customers, vendors, \n\nsuppliers or staff to date, and any potential \n\nnegative impact is likely to diminish as we \n\nmove through the viability period. We \n\nbelieve our stress tests, detailed below, \n\nconsider downsides around reducing \n\nincome that are sufficiently severe to cater \n\nfor any adverse impacts from these Board \n\nchanges, should they arise. \n\nBTG’s gross invoiced income, gross profit \n\nand adjusted operating profit increased \n\nby 26.7%, 12.5% and 12.2% respectively \n\nin 2023/24. The strong growth in gross \n\ninvoiced income reflects the success of \n\nthe business in winning large public-sector \n\nMicrosoft contracts, demonstrating our \n\nstrength and credibility when bidding \n\nfor substantial government software \n\nopportunities under the Crown \n\nCommercial Services framework \n\nagreements. Given the competitive \n\ntendering process involved, these sales \n\nare typically won at reduced initial margins. \n\nAs a result, the growth in gross profit and \n\nadjusted operating profit is lower, although \n\nstill comfortably double-digit. Over the \n\ncourse of the contracts, typically three to \n\nfive years, we have a strategy and track \n\nrecord of growing the profitability of those \n\ncontracts and opening up other software, \n\nhardware or services opportunities within \n\nthose accounts. This reinforces the \n\nongoing viability of our business model, \n\nbecause new accounts such as these \n\ngrow over the viability period. \n\nMore generally, the 2023/24 results \n\ndemonstrate our ability to grow our key \n\nperformance metrics while remaining \n\nresilient to the impact of external \n\ndisruptions. The directors believe this is due \n\nto our mix of customers in the corporate and \n\npublic sectors, strong relationships with our \n\nprimary vendors, the demonstrable value \n\nwe add to our customers and our highly \n\nskilled employees establishing competitive \n\nadvantage in an increasingly digital age. \n\nThe Board reconfirmed BTG’s strategy \n\nin November 2023 and central to its \n\nconclusion that BTG and our operating \n\ncompanies will continue to operate and \n\nmeet our future commitments and \n\nliabilities over the next three years are: \n\n•• The relatively limited impact of external \n\nfactors on customer expenditure \n\n•• Our proven ability to secure strong \n\nlevels of customer renewals and to \n\ngrow the business by winning new \n\ncustomers. \n\nWe carried out the stress tests detailed \n\nbelow, which helped us make sure that \n\nour assessment accurately reflected the \n\nchanges to our business in the past year \n\n– such as our evolving risk management \n\nprocess, and the overall industry and \n\neconomic climate. \n\nHow we stress-tested \n\nour business \n\nIn our stress-testing, we evaluated our \n\nviability by reconsidering: \n\n•• The market forecast models for \n\nour industry \n\n•• Our current and future strategies \n\n•• The potential financial impacts of \n\nour stated principal risks. \n\nThe principal risks were considered \n\nindividually and collectively, in the context \n\nof global political and economic factors \n\nand continued uncertainty around the \n\ncrises in Ukraine and the Middle East. \n\nIn assessing our viability, we applied \n\npotential downside changes to three \n\nkey financial measures – gross invoiced \n\nincome, gross profit and debtor collections \n\n– to see how their performance would alter \n\nif our principal risks and uncertainties were \n\nrealised. Such a realisation is considered \n\nremote, given the robust nature of our \n\nbusiness model combined with the \n\neffectiveness of our risk management \n\nand control systems and our current \n\nrisk appetite. \n\nHowever, we focused on these three financial \n\nmeasures because we believe they’re the \n\nmost likely to be adversely affected – and \n\nto create a progressively negative impact \n\nif they deteriorate continually over the \n\nviability assessment period. \n\nWe also set out our operational mitigations \n\nbelow by considering the extent to which \n\nnegative impacts on the three financial \n\nmeasures could be offset by freezing \n\nfuture pay and recruitment of new heads \n\nand by making savings in discretionary \n\nspend. More automatic and immediate \n\nmitigation is ‘built in’ because commission \n\npayments would fall in line with the reduced \n\ngross profit, ‘natural’ leavers would not be \n\nreplaced and lower dividend payments \n\nwould result from the reduced profits. \n\n64 Bytes Technology Group plc Our most extreme downside scenario, \n\ncase two below, is set within the context of \n\nuncertainty around the current economic \n\nconditions and geopolitical environment. \n\nIn this scenario, we considered the \n\npotential effect of a generalised economic \n\ndownturn on our customers’ spending \n\npatterns. We also took the most extreme \n\nconsidered downside for each of the three \n\nfinancial measures and considered that \n\nonly partial mitigation would be possible. \n\nDetails of our stress-testing \n\nBTG compared a base case scenario and \n\ntwo downside scenarios. In each of the \n\ndownside cases, we considered two \n\nlevels of mitigation, full and partial: \n\n•• Base case – this was forecast using \n\nthe growth rates included in the \n\nBoard-approved budget for the \n\nyear ending 28 February 2025, \n\nextended until 28 February 2027 \n\n•• Downside case one – this severe but \n\nplausible scenario modelled gross \n\ninvoiced income reducing by 10% \n\nyear on year, gross profit reducing by \n\n15% in the same period, and debtor \n\ncollection periods extending by five \n\ndays (all from June 2024) \n\n•• Downside case two – this stress \n\nscenario modelled both gross \n\ninvoiced income and gross profit \n\nreducing by 30% year on year, with \n\ndebtor collection periods extending \n\nby 10 days (again, all from June 2024) \n\n•• Partial mitigation measures – with \n\nthe onset of both downside cases, \n\nwe modelled immediate ‘built-in’ \n\nreduction of commission in line with \n\nfalling gross profit, freezing recruitment \n\nof new heads and not replacing natural \n\nleavers from September 2024, freezing \n\nfuture pay from March 2025 (given \n\ncurrent year rises are already \n\ncommitted) and freezing rises in \n\ngeneral overheads from March 2025 \n\n•• Full mitigation measures – in addition \n\nto all the partial measures, these \n\nmodelled additional headcount \n\nreductions from March 2025, \n\nin line with falling gross profit. \n\nThe impacts of climate change were \n\nconsidered but, because the Board and \n\nmanagement consider that the impacts \n\nwill be immaterial, they fall within the \n\ncurrent (base case) scenario. \n\nThe pay and headcount mitigations \n\napplied in the downside scenarios are \n\nwithin BTG’s control and, depending on \n\nhow severe the impacts of the modelled \n\ndownside scenarios are, the Group could \n\nactivate additional levels of mitigation. \n\nFor example, those relating to headcount \n\nfreezes or reductions could be \n\nimplemented even more quickly than \n\nindicated above to respond to downward \n\ntrends because, considering the sudden \n\nand significant falls in profitability and \n\ncash collections modelled under both \n\ndownsides, we would not wait for a full \n\nthree months before taking action. We \n\nwould also be able to take more action \n\nto lower our operating cost base, given \n\nthe flexibility of our business model. \n\nA natural reduction in the level of \n\nshareholder dividends would follow, \n\nin line with the modelled reductions \n\nin profit after tax. \n\nSo the Board believes that all mitigations \n\nhave been applied prudently and are \n\nwithin BTG’s control. \n\nOur confirmation of viability \n\nHaving assessed the financial impact on \n\nour results of these stress-tested models, \n\nthe Board concluded that our reserves of \n\ncash, our ability to reduce spending and \n\nto extend our revolving credit facility up \n\nto May 2027 – along with our projected \n\nrevenue and profitably over the review \n\nperiod – would mean we could continue \n\ntrading over the next three years. \n\n# Section 172 \n\n# statement \n\nThe Board embraces the principles \n\nof the UK Corporate Governance \n\nCode, including those aimed at \n\npromoting transparency around \n\nstakeholder engagement.
