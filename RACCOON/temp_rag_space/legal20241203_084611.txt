We note that the aforesaid judgment of the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal thereafter came to be affirmed by the Bombay High Court in Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax3, Mumbai v. Ms Blackstone Advisors India Pvt. Ltd.4 and which dismissed the appeal in terms of an order dated 11 March 2019 with the Court observing as follows pblockquote id"blockquote8" quot3. The Respondent Assessee is held to be an investment subadvisor by the Tribunal, with respect to which the Revenue has not raised any dispute in this Appeal. The dispute raised by the Revenue relates to either inclusion or exclusion of certain comparables by the Tribunal while carrying out FAR in case of the Assessee. The Tribunal discarded two entities namely Motilal Oswal Investment Advisory Pvt. Ltd. and Brescon Corporate Advisors Pvt. Ltd. on the ground that these companies were merchant bankers or investment bankers and cannot be compared with the Assessee who was investment subadvisor. The third instance of comparable is of ICRA Management Consulting Services Ltd. The Tribunal accepted the Assesseex27s contention that ICRA Management provided a safe comparable. The Revenue disputes these three findings of the Tribunal. blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote9" span class"citetext" datasentiment"Pos" datadocid"46561356" id"span10"4.

We note that in so far as Chryscapital Investment is concerned, the issue of whether Ms Brescon Advisors amp Holding Ltd. should have been included as a comparable ultimately came to be remanded for fresh consideration. pp datastructure"Precedent" id"p13" 10. In Avenue Asia Advisors Pvt.

The analysis at such a broad level, based upon the appearance of such similar terminologies, does not by itself make the functions similar in nature. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote16" 23. The argument of the assessee appears to be that while the assessee was merely advising on these issues and providing advisory services to its associated enterprise, these three comparables appear to be actually involved in the providing of services relating to debt restructuring, debt financing, issuance of IPOs, mergers and demergers, etc. There is a difference between giving advice on these matters and actually undertaking the said services. A similar illustration, in the context of litigation, would be the difference between giving advice on what to argue in court and actually arguing the matter in the court. This difference needs to be borne in mind and the mere appearance of similar sounding words does not by itself constitute similar functions. Further, as a href"doc133479414" id"a6"laid down ina Rampgreen Solutions supra, all these three companies demonstrated a wide deviation in the percentage of margins. Thus, it requires a deeper analysis to determine as to whether they were in fact comparables to be retained for the purpose of fixing the armx27s length price. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote17" xxxx xxxx xxxx blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote18" 25. In this backdrop, when subadvisory agreement dated July 1, 2006 along with the addendum thereto, is examined, the services of the assessee cannot be termed as that of merchant banking though there may be some overlap in the advisory segment of the services provided by merchant bankers. In view of the services rendered by the assessee, question i is answered in the negative i.e. in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue.quot blockquote p datastructure"Conclusion" id"p15" 12.
