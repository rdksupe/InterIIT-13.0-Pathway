The first issue is against the inclusion of a sum of Rs.47,30,250 in the total income of the assessee. pp datastructure"Facts" id"p4"3. Succinctly, the factual matrix of the case is that the assessee company is a tax resident of France. It is engaged in designing and building dashboards, door panels, floor coverings, sound proofing amp insulation installations and other moulded plastic parts for passenger car interiors. The assessee filed its return declaring NIL income. On perusal of the return, the AO observed that a sum of Rs.47,30,250 received by the assessee from Faurecia Technology Center India Limited hereinafter called Faurecia Indiax27 or Indian entityx27 and also includes reference to its earlier name or its predecessor company was not offered for taxation. On being called upon to explain the reasons for noninclusion of such amount in the total income, the assessee stated that this amount was in the nature of reimbursement of expenses received from the Indian entity which was not chargeable to tax. The assessee stated that it received a sum of Rs. 47.30 lakh by way of reimbursement of salary cost of expatriate, Mr. Franck Euvrard, who was span class"hiddentext" id"span3" 3span span class"hiddentext" id"span4" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding seconded to the Indian entity. It was explained that as per the secondment agreement, Mr. Franck was to render services to the Indian entity. A sum of Rs.47.30 lakh from his salary was paid in France directly by the assessee company, which was later on reimbursed by the Indian entity without any mark up. Not convinced, the AO held that the assessee provided technical services through its staff and hence, the amount was liable to be considered as quotFees for technical servicesquot in terms of a href"doc492579" id"a2"section 91viia of the Act. The assessee remained unsuccessful before the Dispute Resolution Panel DRP as well, which opined that Mr. Franck Euvrard made available his technical knowledge, experience and skill etc. to the Indian entity which was of an enduring nature. It was, therefore, held that such amount was in the nature of quotFees for technical servicesquot covereda href"doc492579" id"a3" us. 91viia of the Act and also Royalty under a href"doc134715" id"a4"Article 13a of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and France hereinafter also called the DTAAx27.

We have heard both the sides and gone through the relevant material on record. In order to reach a proper conclusion as to whether the amount received by the assessee is in the nature of Fees for technical servicesx27 as held by the Department or a simple reimbursement of expenses not chargeable to tax, as canvassed by the assessee, it would be worthwhile to first understand the nature of transaction. Mr. Franck Euvrard was offered the position of Chief Executive Officer CEO of Taco Faurecia Design Center Pvt. Ltd. by a letter issued by the Chairman of the Indian entity on 10042006, whose copy is available at page 322 of the paper book. In this letter, there is a reference to the Offer of appointmentx27 to Mr. Franck Euvrard, whose copy is available at page 323 of the paper book. As per such Offer, the Indian entity was pleased to appoint Mr. Franck Euvrard as its CEO from 01062006 to 30062008 on the terms and conditions set out therein. There is reference to some amount of Basic salary, Housing Assistance, Conveyance allowance, Child education allowance and Special allowance etc. Para 13 of this letter states that quotYou will be required to become a member and will be entitled to the benefits of the Provident Fund and Superannuation Schemes of the Companyquot. Para 14 states that quotYou shall be span class"hiddentext" id"span7" 5span span class"hiddentext" id"span8" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding entitled to leave in accordance with the rules of the Companyx27. Last para of the Offer states that quotYour assignment entails Management Administrative Supervisory responsibilitiesx27. Before expiry of the term on 30062008, Mr. Franck Euvrard was requested to extend his services as CEO of the Indian entity from 01062008 to 31052009 on the same terms and conditions except for hike in salary and other allowances. On 06042009, Mr. Franck Euvrard was once again requested to extend his services as CEO of the company up to 31st May, 2010, which was once again renewed on 02022010 for a period up to 31052011. In the last offer letter, it has been mentioned that all other conditions of his contract remain unchanged. On going through the above documents, it emerges that Mr. Franck Euvrard was appointed by the Indian entity as its CEO way back in the year 2006 and thereafter he got extension from time to time. It is an admitted position that in none of the earlier years, the reimbursement has been taxed in the hands of the assessee. The case of the assessee is that the Indian entity employed Mr. Franck Euvrard on monthly salary and a part of such salary, namely, a sum of Rs.47.30 lakh was paid directly by the assessee to Mr. Franck Euvrard in France during the year, which was later on reimbursed span class"hiddentext" id"span9" 6span span class"hiddentext" id"span10" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding by Faurecia India without any markup. On the contrary, the Revenue has made out a case that the assessee rendered managerial, consultancy or technical services to Faurecia India and hence, such a sum of Rs.47.30 lakh paid as a quid pro quo represents fees for technical services covereda href"doc492579" id"a5" us. 91viia of the Act and consequently chargeable to tax in the hands of the assessee company. p p datastructure"Section" id"p7" 4.2. We need to have a look at a href"doc1369261" id"a6"section 9a of the Act. Subsection 1 of a href"doc1369261" id"a7"section 9a deems certain incomes to accrue or arise in India. This subsection has seven clauses. Clause vii of a href"doc492579" id"a8"section 91a is income by way of fees for technical services payable, inter alia, by a resident. Meaning of the term Fees for technical servicesx27 has been enshrined in Explanation 2 which reads as under pblockquote id"blockquote3" For the purposes of this clause, quotfees for technical servicesquot blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote4" means any consideration including any lump sum consideration for the rendering of any managerial, technical or consultancy services including the provision of services of technical or other personnel but does not include consideration for any construction, assembly, mining or like project undertaken by the recipient or consideration which would be income of the recipient chargeable under the head quotSalariesquot.x27 span class"hiddentext" id"span11" 7span span class"hiddentext" id"span12" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding 4.3. On going through the prescription of the above Explanation, it transpires that any consideration for rendering of managerial, technical or consultancy services including the provision of services of technical or other personnel is fees for technical services. In the present context, if a nonresident provides managerial, technical or consultancy services either directly or through its technical or other personnel, then consideration for the same will be considered as fees for technical services in its hands. The latter part of the Explanation carves out an exception which states, inter alia, that any amount received as fees for technical services within its definition shall not be considered as fees for technical services if the consideration is income of the recipient chargeable under the head quotSalariesquot. Nittygritty of the relevant part of the Explanation is that any consideration received by a non resident from rendition of managerial, technical or consultancy services shall be considered as fees for technical services. If however, such an amount in the hands of recipient is chargeable to tax under the head Salariesx27, then it would shed the character of Fees for technical servicesx27. blockquotespan class"hiddentext" id"span13" 8spanblockquote id"blockquote5" span class"hiddentext" id"span14" ITA No.784PUN2015span blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote6" Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding 4.4. We have noticed supra that Mr. Franck Euvrard was engaged by Faurecia India as its CEO. Like any other employee, his remuneration was directly fixed by the Indian entity which included Basic salary, House rent allowance, Other allowances etc. He was also entitled to the Provident Fund and superannuation benefits. It is neither the case of the Revenue nor any material has been brought on record by the ld. DR to demonstrate that Mr. Franck Euvrard was actually working under control, supervision or direction of the assessee and not Faurecia India. The Indian entity deducted tax at source from total salary paid to Ms. Franck Euvrard, which also included the amount which was initially paid by the assessee in France but later on reimbursed by Faurecia India on cost to cost basis, which constitutes filament of the extant controversy. A copy of Form 26AS, being, TDS certificate in relation to Mr. Franck Euvrard, has been placed at page 333 onwards of the paper book, which evidences deduction of tax at source from his total salary. A copy of statement of total income of Mr. Franck Euvrard is available at page 332 of the paper book, which specifically makes a mention of salary received from Faurecia India and the assessee. Then there is income tax return of Mr. Franck Euvrard, whose copy is available at page 331 of the span class"hiddentext" id"span15" 9span span class"hiddentext" id"span16" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding paper book which again includes salary received from Faurecia India and also the part of salary received from the assessee that was later on reimbursed to it without any profit element. Entire amount was offered to tax under the head Salariesx27. On going through the above factual panorama of the case, it becomes ostensible that a sum of Rs.47.30 lakh which was initially paid by the assessee to Mr. Franck Euvrard as a part of salary payable by Faurecia India in terms of his employment with the Indian entity, has been assessed to tax under the head quotSalariesquot in the hands of Mr. Franck Euvrard. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote7" 4.5. We have noticed above that the second exception in the definition of Fees for technical servicesx27 under the Explanation states that the consideration would cease to be fees for technical services if it is income of the recipientx27 chargeable under the head salariesx27. What is vital to note with reference to the word recipientx27 in the provision is the real recipient and not the literal recipient. If an amount is paid by an Indian entity apparently to an expatriate of a nonresident entity, but the real recipient behind the curtain is nonresident entity, then the nature of amount from the angle of taxability would be viewed in the hands of the real span class"hiddentext" id"span17" 10span span class"hiddentext" id"span18" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding recipient, that is, nonresident entity. Au contraire, if the real recipient is the expatriate in his own right because of his employer employee relationship with the Indian entity, but in a given situation, the nonresident entity just acts as a post office in paying some amount to the expatriate and then receiving it back from the Indian entity on costtocost basis, then the nature of amount from the angle of taxability within the second proviso in the Explanation would have to be viewed in the hands of the real recipient, that is, the expatriate and not the nonresident entity. 4.6. While going through the factual details of the case, we have found out above that Mr. Franck Euvrard was engaged by the Indian entity as its own employee, subject to all the terms and conditions of its own employment. There is nothing like any cloak in the arrangement under which the real recipient of the amount has been suppressed and a faade has been shown. Once Mr. Franck Euvrard has been found to be the real recipient, the chargeability of the amount has to be seen in his hands only. Once the amount paid by the Indian entity is and has been actually charged to tax under the head Salariesx27 in the hands of real recipient, that is, the expatriate in the present case, then going by span class"hiddentext" id"span19" 11span span class"hiddentext" id"span20" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding the command of the second exception in the Explanation, the same cannot be treated as Fees for technical servicesx27 in the hands of the nonresident entity. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote8" 4.7. More significantly, in order to fall within the domain of a href"doc492579" id"a9"section 91viia, it is essential that the amount payable by the Indian resident to the nonresident should be for rendering of any managerial, technical or consultancy services. In other words, the nonresident should provide such managerial, technical or consultancy services. If the services are not rendered by a non resident either through its employees or other personnel, then the question of falling any consideration within the purview of a href"doc492579" id"a10"section 91viia, does not arise. Here, we are confronted with a situation in which Mr. Franck Euvrard was employed by Faurecia India as its CEO. It is not as if Mr. Franck Euvrard was rendering services to Faurecia India on behalf of the assessee for which the amount in dispute was received by the assessee company. Rather, it is a case of Mr. Franck Euvrard working as an employee of Faurecia India. The assessee had no role to play in the rendition of services by Mr. Franck Euvrard to Faurecia India, except that a part of salary payable by the Indian entity was initially paid by the assessee in span class"hiddentext" id"span21" 12span span class"hiddentext" id"span22" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding France to Mr. Franck Euvrard, which was later on recovered without any profit element. Thus, it is held that the sum of Rs.47.30 lac received by the assessee from Faurecia India is not in the nature of fees for technical servicesa href"doc492579" id"a11" us.91viia of the Act. 4.8. It is further relevant to note that the assessee contended before the authorities below that the sum of Rs.47.30 lakh initially paid by it to Mr. Franck Euvrard in France was reimbursed as such by Faurecia India without any profit element. Such a contention of the assessee of reimbursement of the amount on costtocost basis has not been controverted by the AO. In such circumstances, a question arises as to whether reimbursement of expenses without any profit element constitutes income in the hands of the non resident? blockquote blockquote id"blockquote9" span class"citetext" datasentiment"PARTY" datadocid"160121191" id"span23"4.9.

CITa 2014 364 ITR 336 Delhi to bring home his point of view of taxability of the amount despite being reimbursement. He further put forth that SLP filed by the assessee a href"doc160121191" id"a13"in that casea has since been dismissed by the Honx27ble Supreme Court in 2014 227 Taxman 368 SC.span span class"hiddentext" id"span24" 13span span class"hiddentext" id"span25" ITA No.784PUN2015span blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote10" span class"citetext" datasentiment"Pos" datadocid"160121191" id"span26"Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding 4.10. We have gone through the facts of the case obtaining in a href"doc160121191" id"a14"Centrica Indiaa supra. The assessee therein contended that payment to foreign party towards seconded employees was only reimbursement and hence, no income was chargeable to tax in its hands. The Authority for Advance Ruling AAR held that payment made by the petitioner to the overseas entity was in the nature of income in view of the existence of Service Permanent establishment PE in India and hence liable for tax withholding. Overturning the view of the AAR that Service PE was constituted, the Honx27ble High Court held that the payment to AE was in the nature of fees for technical servicesx27 and not reimbursement of expenses and further laid down that the nomenclature of reimbursement was not decisive. It noted that x27Money paid by assessee to overseas entity accrues to overseas entity, which may or may not apply it for payment to secondees, based on its contractual relationship with them.x27 It is perceptible that a href"doc160121191" id"a15"in that casea money paid by the Indian entity accrued to overseas entities only, which could or could not have been paid to the secondees depending upon the terms of contract. Per contra, we are confronted with a situation wherein the money never accrued to the assessee. It initially paid money to Mr. Franck in advance and then span class"hiddentext" id"span27" 14span span class"hiddentext" id"span28" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding recovered the same from the Indian entity without any markup. There can be no question of the assessee receiving money in its own independent right. Rather, it is a case of discharge by the Indian entity of its own liability towards salary payable to Mr. Franck. It is thus manifest that this decision has no application to the facts of the instant case.span blockquote blockquote id"blockquote11" 4.11. span class"citetext" datasentiment"Pos" datadocid"122697173" id"span29"In the oppugnation, the Honx27ble Summit Court in a href"doc122697173" id"a16"DIT International Taxation Vs. A.P. Mollar Maersk A.S.a 2017 392 ITR 186 SC has held that the payment made was in the nature of reimbursement of expenses and hence could not be construed as income chargeable to tax in the hands of recipient. Similar view has been canvassed by the Honx27ble jurisdictional High Court in DITI.T. Vs. Wizcraft International Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. 2014 364 ITR 227 Bom. by holding that payments were reimbursement of expenses and assessee was not obliged to deduct TDS on commission paid to agent.x27 4.12.

Briefly stated, the facts of this additional ground are that the assessee received a sum of Rs.2,66,72,222 from Faurecia India towards provision of Global Information Support services. The same was not offered to tax. On being called upon to explain as to why this amount was not declared as income, the assessee submitted that it provided assistance to run operations, giving technical support and providing studies for adaptation of Information System to meet usersx27 needs, which did not make available any technical knowledge, experience, skill or knowhow etc. to Faurecia India and hence, the same did not fall within the span class"hiddentext" id"span35" 17span span class"hiddentext" id"span36" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding meaning of quotFees for technical servicesquot under a href"doc134715" id"a18"Article 13a of the DTAA with France read with para 7 of the Protocol.

Considering retrospectively inserted Explanation below a href"doc1767760" id"a19"section 92a of the Act and clause iv of Explanation 2 to a href"doc492579" id"a20"section 91via, the AO opined that the amount received by the assessee was in the nature of Royalty. He further held that the amount received by the assessee was also Fees for technical servicesx27 as per Explanation 2 to a href"doc492579" id"a21"section 91viia of the Act.

Having heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material on record, we consider it expedient to, first, discuss the nature of services rendered by the assessee to Faurecia India in terms of Services Agreement dated 3.1.2011, pursuant to which the services were rendered to the Indian entity.

Technical Support FAH provides local IT support to users on site to order, change or upgrade PC or local applications and infrastructure issues, core competence centres for dedicated applications and c.

The above discussed services provided by the assessee to Furaceia India are largely in the nature of technical services. pp datastructure"PetArg" id"p21"13. Though the assessee contended before the AO that it rendered only IT Support services, however, on perusal of sample invoices submitted by the assessee before the Tribunal, it turns out span class"hiddentext" id"span49" 24span span class"hiddentext" id"span50" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding that it rendered not only IT Support services but also managerial services. For example, a copy of Invoice no. 1800000289 for the services rendered during the period 9.11.2011 to 20.11.2011 gives the description of services as BG Fees , Group Fees, IT Fees, Division Fees and Purchase Feesx27. Though this invoice relates to the next year, the ld. AR admitted that the nature of services rendered by the assessee during the year under consideration were on the same lines as depicted in the above referred invoice. It, therefore, emerges that the assessee rendered to the Indian entity not only IT support services, which outnumber others, but also some part consists of managerial services. p p datastructure"Precedent" id"p22" pp datastructure"Section" id"p23"14. The AO has characterized receipt of fees for the above services both as quotRoyaltyquot as well as quotFees for technical servicesquot pblockquote id"blockquote17"under the Act as well as the DTAA. blockquote p datastructure"Section" id"p24"15.1. We will first examine if the receipt can be considered as quotRoyaltyquot? a href"doc492579" id"a23"Section 91via of the Act deals with income by way of Royalty payable, inter alia, by a resident. The term Royaltyx27 has been defined in Explanation 2 which has six clauses. The case of the AO is that the assessee received Royalty in terms of clause pp datastructure"Section" id"p25"iv of Explanation to a href"doc492579" id"a24"section 91a of the Act, which provides that span class"hiddentext" id"span51" 25span span class"hiddentext" id"span52" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding any consideration for quotiv the imparting of any information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific knowledge, experience or skillx27 shall be considered as Royalty. On going through the prescription of clause iv, it becomes pertinent to note that before the words quottechnical, industrial, commercial or scientific knowledge, experience or skillquot, the legislature has used the expression quotimparting of any information concerningquot. The word quotimpartingquot assumes significance in this context. This word does not connote rendering some services involving technical, industrial, commercial or scientific knowledge etc. Rather, it refers to imparting of information regarding some technical, industrial, commercial or scientific quotknowledge, experience or skillquot. When we read the word impartingx27 in the beginning of the provision in conjunction with quotknowledge, experience, or skillquot at the end of the provision, it becomes crystal clear that the same refers to providing some technical, industrial or commercial knowhow etc. to be used by the recipient and not consuming it as such as a service received. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p26" 15.2. At this stage, it is imperative to appreciate that we are dealing with the definition of the term Royaltyx27, which is span class"hiddentext" id"span53" 26span span class"hiddentext" id"span54" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding primarily a consideration for use of intellectual properties, such as, patent, model or invention etc. or technical, industrial or scientific knowledge or specified types of industrial or commercial equipments etc. Placement of clause iv in the Explanation 2, which is a part of income by way of Royaltyx27, itself implies that the consideration referred to herein is for use of some right, property or information concerning technical, industrial or commercial knowledge etc. and not a mere rendering of services involving some technical expertise etc.. In Warley Parson Services Pty. Ltd. in Re 2009 313 ITR 74 AAR, the Authority has held that mere rendering of technical services is not sufficient to attract that clause but the expert knowledge, skills etc. behind the service should be imparted to the other contracting party, that is to say, there has to be a transfer of technical knowhow. In view of the foregoing discussion, it becomes evident that the IT support services rendered by the assessee, which are otherwise technical in nature, do not involve any imparting of information concerning technical, industrial, or commercial knowledge to Faurecia, India. The same being a mere rendering of services, cannot be brought within the scope of a href"doc492579" id"a25"section 91via of the Act. In view of our decision about the receipt not falling within the ambit of a href"doc1621547" id"a26"section span class"hiddentext" id"span55" 27spana span class"hiddentext" id"span56" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding 91vi of the Act, there is no need to examine the relevant provision under the DTAA. We, therefore, hold that the amount received by the assessee is not in the nature of Royalty. pp datastructure"Section" id"p27"16. Next we proceed to examine if the payment received by the assessee can be considered as Fees for technical servicesx27? a href"doc492579" id"a27"Section 91viia deals with income by way of Fees for technical servicesx27 payable, inter alia, by a resident. Definition of the expression Fees for technical servicesx27 has been extracted in an earlier part of this order. On going through such provision, to the extent it is relevant for our purpose, it deciphers that fees for technical services means any consideration for rendering managerial, technical or consultancy services excluding any consideration for construction, assembly, mining etc. It is nobodyx27s claim that the case is covered under the exception. We have hereinabove discussed the nature of services rendered by the assessee to the Indian entity and held these to be technical as well as managerial services. That being the position, the transaction is caught within the scope of fees for technical servicesx27 us.91vii of the Act. span class"hiddentext" id"span57" 28span span class"hiddentext" id"span58" ITA No.784PUN2015span pp datastructure"Conclusion" id"p28" Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding pp datastructure"Section" id"p29"span class"citetext" datasentiment"Pos" datadocid"1725672" id"span59"17. a href"doc292995" id"a28"Section 901a of the Act provides that the Central Government may enter into an agreement with the Government of any other country for the granting of relief of tax in respect of income on which tax has been paid in two different tax jurisdictions. Sub section 2 of a href"doc68317" id"a29"section 90a unequivocally provides that where the Central Government has entered into an agreement with the Government of any country outside India under subsection 1 for granting relief of tax or for avoidance of double taxation, then, in relation to the assessee to whom such agreement applies, x27the provisions of this Act shall apply to the extent they are more beneficial to that assesseex27. Crux of subsection 2 is that where a DTAA has been entered into with another country, then the provisions of the Act shall apply only if they are more beneficial to the assessee. In simple words, if there is a conflict between the provisions under the Act and the DTAA, the assessee will be subjected to the more beneficial provision out of the two. If the provision of the Act on a particular issue is more beneficial to the assessee visavis that in the DTAA, then such provision of the Act shall apply and vice versa. The Honx27ble Supreme Court in the case of a href"doc1725672" id"a30"CIT v. P.V.A.L. Kulandagan Chettiara 2004 267 ITR 654 SC has held that the provisions of a href"doc339978" id"a31"sections 4a and a href"doc65305" id"a32"5a are subject to the span class"hiddentext" id"span60" 29span span class"hiddentext" id"span61" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding contrary provision, if any, in DTAA.

In the light of the above discussion, it becomes vivid that if the provisions of the Treaty are more beneficial to the assessee visavis its counterpart in the Act, then the assessee shall be entitled to be ruled by the provisions of the Treaty.span p p datastructure"Section" id"p30" 18.1. Having seen that the payment falls within the definition of Fees for technical servicesx27 under the Act, let us examine the position under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and France. a href"doc134715" id"a36"Article 13a of the DTAA deals with Royalties and Fees for technical services. Para 4 of a href"doc134715" id"a37"Article 13a defines the term quotFees for technical servicesquot as under pblockquote id"blockquote18" The term quotfees for technical servicesquot as used in this Article means payments of any kind to any person, other than payments to an employee of the person making the payments and to any individual for independent personal services mentioned in a href"doc609295" id"a38"Article 15a, in consideration for services of a managerial, technical or consultancy nature.x27 span class"hiddentext" id"span63" 30span span class"hiddentext" id"span64" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding 18.2. On going through the mandate of para 4 of a href"doc134715" id"a39"Article 13a defining the term Fees for technical servicesx27, it becomes plain that the same refers to a consideration for services of managerial, technical or consultancy nature. It turns out that definition of the expression Fees for technical servicesx27 under a href"doc134715" id"a40"Article 13a of the DTAA is by and large similar to that given in a href"doc492579" id"a41"section 91viia of the Act to this extent, which does not directly support the case of the assessee. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote19"18.3. At this stage, it would be relevant to refer to the Protocol, which for all practical purposes, is considered as a part and parcel of the DTAA. Relevant part of para 7 of the Protocol dated 29092012 between India and France, reads as under blockquote blockquote id"blockquote20" In respect of a href"doc1678224" id"a42"Articles 11 Dividendsaa href"doc609139" id"a43", 12 Interesta and a href"doc134715" id"a44"13 Royaltiesa, fees for technical services and payments for the use of equipment, if under any Convention, Agreement or Protocol signed after 1st Sept., 1989, between India and a third State which is a member of the OECD, India limits its taxation at source on dividends, interest, royalties, fees for technical services or payments for the use of equipment to a rate lower or a scope more restricted than the rate of scope provided for in this Convention on the said items of income, the same rate or scope as provided for in that Convention, Agreement or Protocol on the said items income shall also apply under this Convention, with effect from the date on which the present Convention or the relevant Indian Convention, Agreement or Protocol enters into force, whichever enters into force later.x27 span class"hiddentext" id"span65" 31span span class"hiddentext" id"span66" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding 18.4. A careful circumspection of para 7 of the Protocol indicates that the same contains a Most Favoured Nation MFN clause, as per which, if India enters into a DTAA after 01091989 with a third state which is a member of the OECD and the rate of taxation or scope of fees for technical services etc. under such other DTAA with a third state is narrower than para 4 of a href"doc134715" id"a45"Article 13a of the DTAA with France, then such lower rate or restricted scope shall apply under the DTAA with France. Net effect of the MFN clause in the present context is that if India has entered into a DTAA with a third state which is a member of the OECD and the scope of the term quotFees for technical servicesquot under such DTAA with a third state is limited visvis its scope given in the DTAA with France, then such limited scope as per the DTAA with the third state shall stand substituted in place of para 4 of a href"doc134715" id"a46"Article 13a of DTAA with France. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote21" 18.5. In this connection, it is seen that India entered into a DTAA with the UK, which is a member of the OECD. a href"doc134715" id"a47"Article 13a of such DTAA with the UK defines the term quotFees for technical servicesquot under para 4 of a href"doc134715" id"a48"Article 13a, as under blockquotespan class"hiddentext" id"span67" 32spanblockquote id"blockquote22" span class"hiddentext" id"span68" ITA No.784PUN2015span blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote23" Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding For the purposes of paragraph 2 of this Article, and subject to paragraph 5, of this Article, the term quotfees for technical servicesquot blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote24" means payments of any kind to any person in consideration for the rendering of any technical or consultancy services including the provision of services of technical or other personnel which blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote25" a are ancillary and subsidiary to the application or enjoyment of the right, property or information for which a payment described in paragraph 3a of this Article is received or blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote26" b are ancillary and subsidiary to the enjoyment of the property for which a payment described in paragraph 3b of this article is received or blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote27" c make available technical knowledge, experience, skill, know blockquotep datastructure"Section" id"p31" how or processes, or consist of the development and transfer of a technical plan or technical design.x27 18.6. On going through a href"doc430906" id"a49"Article 134a of DTAA with the UK, it can be seen that the term quotFees for technical servicesquot has three constituents. Clauses a and b deal with payment for services which are ancillary and subsidiary to the enjoyment of right, property or information for which payment has been described under paras 3 a and b of this Article. Para 3 of a href"doc134715" id"a50"Article 13a defines Royaltiesx27 to mean payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of a literary, artistic or scientific work etc. or any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment etc. Thus, it is seen that clauses a and b of para 4 of the DTAA with the UK are not relevant for our purpose. Then there is clause c of para 4 which span class"hiddentext" id"span69" 33span span class"hiddentext" id"span70" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding states that the term quotfees for technical servicesquot means payment of any kind for rendering any technical or consultancy services which quotmake availablequot technical knowledge, experience, skill, know how or processes or consists of the development and transfer of a technical plan or technical design. This clause bears usefulness in so far as interpretation of a href"doc430906" id"a51"Article 134a of the DTAA with France is concerned. In view of the MFN clause in the Protocol, a href"doc430906" id"a52"Article 134a of the DTAA with the UK shall overshadow a href"doc430906" id"a53"Article 134a of the DTAA with France and limit the scope of the DTAA with France to the extent provided in the DTAA with the UK. Following two things emerge on going through the ambit of quotFees for technical servicesquot under a href"doc430906" id"a54"Article 134ca of the DTAA with the UK. First is that unlike a href"doc430906" id"a55"Article 134a of DTAA with France defining quotFees for technical servicesquot as quotconsideration for services of managerial, technical or consultancy naturequot, a href"doc430906" id"a56"Article 134a of the UK DTAA defines quotFees for technical servicesquot as payment for rendering of only technical or consultancy servicesx27. The term managerialx27 is missing in so far as the scope of quotFees for technical servicesquot under the DTAA with the UK is concerned. The second departure in the DTAA with the UK from the DTAA with France is that the scopex27 of technical or consultancy services span class"hiddentext" id"span71" 34span span class"hiddentext" id"span72" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding in the DTAA with the UK has been restricted to make availablex27 any technical knowledge, experience, skill, knowhow or processes etc. In fact, the reason for omission of the word managerialx27 from the definition of the expression fees for technical servicesx27 in the DTAA with the UK is comprehensible. It is so because the clause refers to making available the services. Unlike technical or consultancy services, managerial services cannot be made available for use in future. This appears to be the raison dx27etre for exclusion of the term managerialx27 services from the definition. Thus, a reading of a href"doc430906" id"a57"Article 134ca of the DTAA with the UK, when read in place of a href"doc430906" id"a58"Article 134a of the DTAA with France, deciphers that quotFees for technical servicesquot shall mean any payment for rendering of any technical or consultancy services which make availablex27 technical knowledge, experience or skill etc. to the recipient. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p32" 18.7. We have adverted to the nature of services rendered by the assessee to Faurecia India and found them to be Managerial and also Technical in nature. In so far as the Managerial services are concerned, the consideration for them goes out of the purview of Fees for technical servicesx27, as the term quotmanagerialquot is absent span class"hiddentext" id"span73" 35span span class"hiddentext" id"span74" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding in a href"doc430906" id"a59"Article 134a of the DTAA with UK. Case of the AO rests on treating consideration for such services as Royaltyx27 or Fees for technical servicesx27 only. Resultantly, payment for the Managerial services cannot be brought with in the scope of the term Fees for technical servicesx27 under Article 13 of the DTAA with France as read in conjunction with the DTAA with the UK. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p33" 18.8. As far as the remaining Technical services rendered by the assessee to Faurecia India are concerned, it is seen that these are of coordinating the Information system and assisting Faurecia India in computerisation of systems, office automation and utilisation of personal computers which fall into the aforesaid three categories namely, Operations, Technical support and Studies. On going through the nature of such services, it is manifested that these do not result in making available any technical knowhow etc. to the Faurecia India. p p datastructure"Precedent" id"p34" span class"citetext" datasentiment"Pos" datadocid"62929003" id"span75"18.9. The term quotmake availablequot has come up for consideration before the Honx27ble Karnataka High Court in a href"doc62929003" id"a60"CIT Vs. De Beers India Minerals Pvt. Ltd.a 2012 346 ITR 467 Kar. in which it has been held that this term means that the payer of the services should be able to utilise the acquired knowledge or knowhow at his own span class"hiddentext" id"span76" 36span span class"hiddentext" id"span77" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding in future without the aid of service provider. The Authority for Advance Ruling in Production resources group, in Re 2018 401 ITR 56 AAR has also held that quotmake availablequot connotes something which results in transmitting the technical knowledge so that the recipient could derive an enduring benefit and utilise the same in future on his own without the aid and assistance of the provider. On going through the above interpretation, it becomes palpable that in order to make availablex27 technical services, it is sine qua non that the payer of the services must acquire such technical knowhow etc. which he can himself use in future without any assistance of the provider and the same is not any such act or service which vanishes or disappears on its provision by the payee itself.span p p datastructure"Section" id"p35" 18.10. When we advert to the nature of the Technical services rendered by the assessee, it gets axiomatic that no technical knowledge was made available by the assessee to Faurecia India for its use thereafter. Rather, it is a case of providing a service involving technical knowledge, which got consumed with its provision itself. Since such services simply involve use of technical knowledge and do not result into handing over some span class"hiddentext" id"span78" 37span span class"hiddentext" id"span79" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding technical knowhow to Faurecia India, the same, in our considered opinion, cannot be termed as quotFees for technical servicesquot under the DTAA. p p datastructure"Section" id"p36" 18.11. Thus, it is overt that the total amount received by the assessee for rendition of services to Faurecia India, which is a mixed bag of Managerial and Technical services, does not eventually make available any technical knowledge, experience, skill, knowhow etc. to the India entity and hence the same cannot in our considered opinion be considered as Fees for technical servicesx27 under Article 134 of the DTAA with France when read with the Protocol and Article 134 of DTAA with the UK. pp datastructure"Section" id"p37"19. Reliance of the ld. AO on the Explanation below a href"doc1767760" id"a61"section 92a of the Act is of no consequence. This Explanation simply states that income of a nonresident shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India, inter alia, under clauses vi or vii of subsection 1 of a href"doc1369261" id"a62"section 9a and shall be included in the total income of the non resident, whether or not i the nonresident has a residence or place of business or business connection in India or ii the non resident has rendered services in India. In the instant appeal, the issue is whether the services rendered by the assessee fall within span class"hiddentext" id"span80" 38span span class"hiddentext" id"span81" ITA No.784PUN2015span Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding the definition of Royaltiesx27 or Fees for technical servicesx27 us 91vi or vii of the Act. We have held that a href"doc492579" id"a63"section 91via is not attracted. Albeit a href"doc492579" id"a64"section 91viia is attracted, but the amount ceases to be Fees for technical servicesx27 in the light of the DTAA. Thus, there is no quarrel on whether or not the assessee has a place of business or business connection in India or it has rendered services in or outside India. The position would have been otherwise if the assessee had been covereda href"doc492579" id"a65" us 91via or vii and not getting immunity under the DTAA and then claiming that no income on this score should be included in its total income as either it had no place of business in India etc. or the services were not rendered in India. As such, the reliance of the ld. AO on the Explanation below a href"doc1767760" id"a66"section 92a of the Act, for fortifying his point of view that the amount in question be charged to tax, is pointless. pp datastructure"Precedent" id"p38"20. As the extant payment received by the assessee can neither be construed as Royaltyx27 us 91vi of the Act nor as Fees for technical servicesx27 under the DTAA, the same cannot be included in the total income of the assessee. Ex consequenti, we overturn the impugned order on this score and order the deletion of the addition. span class"hiddentext" id"span82" 39span span class"hiddentext" id"span83" ITA No.784PUN2015span pp datastructure"Conclusion" id"p39" Ms.Faurecia Automotive Holding pp datastructure"Conclusion" id"p40"21.
