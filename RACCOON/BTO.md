### 2.4 Margin Analysis
**Profitability Margins** depict B2Gold’s ability to convert revenue into profit:
- **EBIT Margin** (Operating Income/Revenue):  
  \[

  \]
  \[
  \text{2022 EBIT Margin} = \frac{541459000.0}{1732590000.0} \times 100 \approx 31.2\%
  \]
- The significant decline in this margin implies heightened operational costs and inefficiency, which can be linked to external factors like fluctuating gold prices or increasing material costs.
